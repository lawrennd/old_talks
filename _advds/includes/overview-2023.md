\section{Course Overview}

\notes{Advanced Data Science is a four-week unit that will give you both a broad overview of the challenges of data science as well as a deep understanding of the stages involved in delivering a data science pipeline. }

\notes{Welcome to this course!}

\subsection{An Emerging Field}

\notes{Data science is an emerging field, in this unit we'll introduce you to the phenomena that are triggering it, and the challenges we face. It is not an activity that is currently done *well*. In some places it is done better than others, but there's a particular onus on us as educators, and you as students, to realize that our understanding of the challenge is evolving. That evolving understanding requires us to adapt to the problems as they develop and maintain a wider contextual understanding of the effects we are having on society.}

\notes{For that reason, the unit is not purely technical, it is at times philosophical and ethical. That is not to say we have a unique access to the philosophies and ethics that are required to undertake the challenges of data science, but to trigger your thinking because you are in the generation of computer scientists on whom the burden of responsibility is falling to address these challenges.}

\notes{Your assessments are designed to develop these skills alongside your technical understanding. They are ambitious in their scope, but unless you see the entire data science pipeline you won't be prepared to assimilate the challenges we're facing. Our aim is to guide you through the challenges of the assessment through the lab sessions and practicals and to ensure that you develop your understanding of these challenges with our help.}

\notes{The teaching is based not only on technical experience of the machine learning community, but real-world experience of deploying and/or assisting with deployments of data science solutions at Amazon, for pandemic policy advice and in the African context (particularly Uganda and Kenya).}

\subsection{Assessment}

\slides{* Available already in Moodle.
* Will be able to complete as we teach.
* After each lab session is complete, progress in assessment.
* Revisit your questions to "refactor" your code before submission.}

\notes{Your assessment is [available in Moodle](https://www.vle.cam.ac.uk/). The assessment is tightly integrated with the course lecturing, it is staged so that you should be able to make a start on the first question as soon as you've finished Lab Session One. Your assessment should progress alongside the course with different questions becoming easier to answer as you complete each of the labs.}
