abstract:  >
  This lecture will introduce us to the context of why we are doing data science. What is data science and how does it differ from classical statistics, machine learning and artificial intelligence. We will set the context by introducing the notion of *embodiment factors*. These factors allow us to characterize human and machine intelligence and highlight that in the modern data driven world a symbiotic relationship with the machine is emerging. Unfortunately, the high bandwidth capability of the machine means that it has at a disadvantage. Just as the field of mathematical statistics developed to mediate the relationship between humans and data, the field of data science is emerging to mediate the relationship between human machine and data. This background will give the context to what will follow in the rest of the course where you will gain practical skills and experience of developing the full data science pipeline.

\subsection{What Next?}

\slides{* Review notebook (covers `pandas`, probability and correlation)
* Practical 1 (more `pandas`, setting up SQL on AWS, uploading data and performing joins with SQL).
* Read through assignment to contextualise material.}

\notes{As a refresher, we've provided a notebook to remind yourselves about probability and correlation, <https://mlatcl.github.io/advds/lectures/review-and-refresher.html>. We recommend that you go through exercises 4-9 of this notebook as soon as possible.}

\notes{You can also make a start on the first practical, <https://mlatcl.github.io/ads/lectures/practical-one.html> which covers SQL databases and joins.}

\notes{You should also give the main assignment (available through [Moodle](https://vle.cam.ac.uk)) a read through to give yourself a sense of the questions you'll need to answer.}
