abstract: "<p>Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the current revolution in “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines and is having a significant influence on the wider tech agenda. In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with machine learning solutions, and what challenges we face both in the near and far future. These include practical application of existing algorithms in the face of the need to explain decision making, mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data, dealing with large unstructured datasets.</p>"

<p>Machine learning allows us to extract knowledge from data to form a prediction.</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\text{data} + \text{model} \xrightarrow{\text{compute}} \text{prediction}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>A machine learning prediction is made by combining a model with data to form the prediction. The manner in which this is done gives us the machine learning <em>algorithm</em>.</p>
<p>Machine learning models are <em>mathematical models</em> which make weak assumptions about data, e.g. smoothness assumptions. By combining these assumptions with the data, we observe we can interpolate between data points or, occasionally, extrapolate into the future.</p>
<p>Machine learning is a technology which strongly overlaps with the methodology of statistics. From a historical/philosophical view point, machine learning differs from statistics in that the focus in the machine learning community has been primarily on accuracy of prediction, whereas the focus in statistics is typically on the interpretability of a model and/or validating a hypothesis through data collection.</p>
<p>The rapid increase in the availability of compute and data has led to the increased prominence of machine learning. This prominence is surfacing in two different but overlapping domains: data science and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence has the objective of endowing computers with human-like intelligent capabilities. For example, understanding an image (computer vision) or the contents of some speech (speech recognition), the meaning of a sentence (natural language processing) or the translation of a sentence (machine translation).</p>
<h3 id="supervised-learning-for-ai">Supervised Learning for AI</h3>
<p>The machine learning approach to artificial intelligence is to collect and annotate a large data set from humans. The problem is characterized by input data (e.g. a particular image) and a label (e.g. is there a car in the image yes/no). The machine learning algorithm fits a mathematical function (I call this the <em>prediction function</em>) to map from the input image to the label. The parameters of the prediction function are set by minimizing an error between the function’s predictions and the true data. This mathematical function that encapsulates this error is known as the <em>objective function</em>.</p>
<p>This approach to machine learning is known as <em>supervised learning</em>. Various approaches to supervised learning use different prediction functions, objective functions or different optimization algorithms to fit them.</p>
<p>For example, <em>deep learning</em> makes use of <em>neural networks</em> to form the predictions. A neural network is a particular type of mathematical function that allows the algorithm designer to introduce invariances into the function.</p>
<p>An invariance is an important way of including prior understanding in a machine learning model. For example, in an image, a car is still a car regardless of whether it’s in the upper left or lower right corner of the image. This is known as translation invariance. A neural network encodes translation invariance in <em>convolutional layers</em>. Convolutional neural networks are widely used in image recognition tasks.</p>
<p>An alternative structure is known as a recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs neural networks encode temporal structure. They use auto regressive connections in their hidden layers, they can be seen as time series models which have non-linear auto-regressive basis functions. They are widely used in speech recognition and machine translation.</p>
<p>Machine learning has been deployed in Speech Recognition (e.g. Alexa, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks for speech recognition), in computer vision (e.g. Amazon Go, convolutional neural networks for person recognition and pose detection).</p>
<p>The field of data science is related to AI, but philosophically different. It arises because we are increasingly creating large amounts of data through <em>happenstance</em> rather than active collection. In the modern era data is laid down by almost all our activities. The objective of data science is to extract insights from this data.</p>
<p>Classically, in the field of statistics, data analysis proceeds by assuming that the question (or scientific hypothesis) comes before the data is created. E.g., if I want to determine the effectiveness of a particular drug, I perform a <em>design</em> for my data collection. I use foundational approaches such as randomization to account for confounders. This made a lot of sense in an era where data had to be actively collected. The reduction in cost of data collection and storage now means that many data sets are available which weren’t collected with a particular question in mind. This is a challenge because bias in the way data was acquired can corrupt the insights we derive. We can perform randomized control trials (or A/B tests) to verify our conclusions, but the opportunity is to use data science techniques to better guide our question selection or even answer a question without the expense of a full randomized control trial (referred to as A/B testing in modern internet parlance).</p>

<p>Figure: Packhorse Bridge under Burbage Edge. This packhorse route climbs steeply out of Hathersage and heads towards Sheffield. Packhorses were the main route for transporting goods across the Peak District. The high cost of transport is one driver of the 'smith' model, where there is a local skilled person responsible for assembling or creating goods (e.g. a blacksmith).</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>On Sunday mornings in Sheffield, I often used to run across Packhorse Bridge in Burbage valley. The bridge is part of an ancient network of trails crossing the Pennines that, before Turnpike roads arrived in the 18th century, was the main way in which goods were moved. Given that the moors around Sheffield were home to sand quarries, tin mines, lead mines and the villages in the Derwent valley were known for nail and pin manufacture, this wasn't simply movement of agricultural goods, but it was the infrastructure for industrial transport.</p>
<p>The profession of leading the horses was known as a Jagger and leading out of the village of Hathersage is Jagger's Lane, a trail that headed underneath Stanage Edge and into Sheffield.</p>
<p>The movement of goods from regions of supply to areas of demand is fundamental to our society. The physical infrastructure of supply chain has evolved a great deal over the last 300 years.</p>

<p>Figure: Richard Arkwright is regarded of the founder of the modern factory system. Factories exploit distribution networks to centralize production of goods. Arkwright located his factory in Cromford due to proximity to Nottingham Weavers (his market) and availability of water power from the tributaries of the Derwent river. When he first arrived there was almost no transportation network. Over the following 200 years The Cromford Canal (1790s), a Turnpike (now the A6, 1816-18) and the High Peak Railway (now closed, 1820s) were all constructed to improve transportation access as the factory blossomed.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Richard Arkwright is known as the father of the modern factory system. In 1771 he set up a Mill for spinning cotton yarn in the village of Cromford, in the Derwent Valley. The Derwent valley is relatively inaccessible. Raw cotton arrived in Liverpool from the US and India. It needed to be transported on packhorse across the bridleways of the Pennines. But Cromford was a good location due to proximity to Nottingham, where weavers where consuming the finished thread, and the availability of water power from small tributaries of the Derwent river for Arkwright's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny">water frames</a> which automated the production of yarn from raw cotton.</p>
<p>By 1794 the Cromford canal was opened to bring coal in to Cromford and give better transport to Nottingham. The construction of the canals was driven by the need to improve the transport infrastructure, facilitating the movement of goods across the UK. Canals, roads and railways were initially constructed by the economic need for moving goods. To improve supply chain.</p>

<p>Figure: The container is one of the major drivers of globalization, and arguably the largest agent of social change in the last 100 years. It reduces the cost of transportation, significantly changing the appropriate topology of distribution networks. The container makes it possible to ship goods halfway around the world for cheaper than it costs to process those goods, leading to an extended distribution topology.</p>

<p>Figure: Wild Alaskan Cod, being solid in the Pacific Northwest, that is a product of China. It is cheaper to ship the deep frozen fish thousands of kilometers for processing than to process locally.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For example, you can buy Wild Alaskan Cod fished from Alaska, processed in China, sold in North America. This is driven by the low cost of transport for frozen cod vs the higher relative cost of cod processing in the US versus China. Similarly, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1534286/12000-mile-trip-to-have-seafood-shelled.html" target="_blank" >Scottish prawns are also processed in China for sale in the UK.</a></p>
<p>This effect on cost of transport vs cost of processing is the main driver of the topology of the modern supply chain and the associated effect of globalization. If transport is much cheaper than processing, then processing will tend to agglomerate in places where processing costs can be minimized.</p>
<p>Large scale global economic change has principally been driven by changes in the technology that drives supply chain.</p>
<p>Supply chain is a large-scale automated decision making network. Our aim is to make decisions not only based on our models of customer behavior (as observed through data), but also by accounting for the structure of our fulfilment center, and delivery network.</p>
<p>Many of the most important questions in supply chain take the form of counterfactuals. E.g. “What would happen if we opened a manufacturing facility in Cambridge?” A counter factual is a question that implies a mechanistic understanding of a system. It goes beyond simple smoothness assumptions or translation invariants. It requires a physical, or <em>mechanistic</em> understanding of the supply chain network. For this reason, the type of models we deploy in supply chain often involve simulations or more mechanistic understanding of the network.</p>
<p>In supply chain Machine Learning alone is not enough, we need to bridge between models that contain real mechanisms and models that are entirely data driven.</p>
<p>This is challenging, because as we introduce more mechanism to the models we use, it becomes harder to develop efficient algorithms to match those models to data.</p>

<p><span class="math inline">data + model</span> is not new, it dates back to Laplace and Gauss. Gauss fitted the orbit of Ceres using Keplers laws of planetary motion to generate his basis functions, and Laplace's insights on the error function and uncertainty <span class="citation">(Stigler 1999)</span>. Different fields such as Operations Research, Control, Econometrics, Statistics, Machine Learning and now Data Science and AI all rely on <span class="math inline">data + model</span>. Under a Popperian view of science, and equating experiment to data, one could argue that all science has <span class="math inline">data + model</span> underpinning it.</p>
<p>Different academic fields are born in different eras, driven by different motivations and arrive at different solutions. For example, both Operations Research and Control emerged from the Second World War. Operations Research, the science of decision making, driven by the need for improved logistics and supply chain. Control emerged from cybernetics, a field that was driven in the by researchers who had been involved in radar and decryption <span class="citation">(Wiener 1948; Husband, Holland, and Wheeler 2008)</span>. The UK artificial intelligence community had similar origins <span class="citation">(Copeland 2006)</span>.</p>
<p>The separation between these fields has almost become tribal, and from one perspective this can be very helpful. Each tribe can agree on a common language, a common set of goals and a shared understanding of the approach they’ve chose for those goals. This ensures that best practice can be developed and shared and as a result, quality standards can rise.</p>
<p>This is the nature of our <em>professions</em>. Medics, lawyers, engineers and accountants all have a system of shared best practice that they deploy efficiently in the resolution of a roughly standardized set of problems where they deploy (broken leg, defending a libel trial, bridging a river, ensuring finances are correct).</p>
<p>Control, statistics, economics, operations research are all established professions. Techniques are established, often at undergraduate level, and graduation to the profession is regulated by professional bodies. This system works well as long as the problems we are easily categorized and mapped onto the existing set of known problems.</p>
<p>However, at another level our separate professions of OR, statistics and control engineering are just different views on the same problem. Just as any tribe of humans need to eat and sleep, so do these professions depend on data, modelling, optimization and decision-making.</p>
<p>We are doing something that has never been done before, optimizing and evolving very large-scale automated decision making networks. The ambition to scale and automate, in a <em>data driven</em> manner, means that a tribal approach to problem solving can hinder our progress. Any tribe of hunter gatherers would struggle to understand the operation of a modern city. Similarly, supply chain needs to develop cross-functional skill sets to address the modern problems we face, not the problems that were formulated in the past.</p>
<p>Many of the challenges we face are at the interface between our tribal expertise. We have particular cost functions we are trying to minimize (an expertise of OR) but we have large scale feedbacks in our system (an expertise of control). We also want our systems to be adaptive to changing circumstances, to perform the best action given the data available (an expertise of machine learning and statistics).</p>
<p>Taking the tribal analogy further, we could imagine each of our professions as a separate tribe of hunter-gathers, each with particular expertise (e.g. fishing, deer hunting, trapping). Each of these tribes has their own approach to eating to survive, just as each of our localized professions has its own approach to modelling. But in this analogy, the technological landscapes we face are not wildernesses, they are emerging metropolises. Our new task is to feed our population through a budding network of supermarkets. While we may be sourcing our food in the same way, this requires new types of thinking that don't belong in the pure domain of any of our existing tribes.</p>
<p>For our biggest challenges, focusing on the differences between these fields is unhelpful, we should consider their strengths and how they overlap. Fundamentally all these fields are focused on taking the right action given the information available to us. They need to work in <em>synergy</em> for us to make progress.</p>
<p>While there is some discomfort in talking across field boundaries, it is critical to disconfirming our current beliefs and generating the new techniques we need to address the challenges before us.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: We should be aware of the limitations of a single tribal view of any of our problem sets. Where our modelling is dominated by one perspective (e.g. economics, OR, control, ML) we should ensure cross fertilization of ideas occurs through scientific review and team rotation mechanisms that embed our scientists (for a short period) in different teams across our organizations.</p>
<h2 id="the-three-ds-of-machine-learning-systems-design">The Three Ds of Machine Learning Systems Design</h2>
<p>We can characterize the challenges for integrating machine learning within our systems as the three Ds. Decomposition, Data and Deployment.</p>
<p>The first two components <em>decomposition</em> and <em>data</em> are interlinked, but we will first outline the decomposition challenge. Below we will mainly focus on <em>supervised learning</em> because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.</p>
<h2 id="data-edit">Data <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ml/includes/ml-data-challenge.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ml/includes/ml-data-challenge.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h2>
<p>It is difficult to overstate the importance of data. It is half of the equation for machine learning but is often utterly neglected. We can speculate that there are two reasons for this. Firstly, data cleaning is perceived as tedious. It doesn’t seem to consist of the same intellectual challenges that are inherent in constructing complex mathematical models and implementing them in code. Secondly, data cleaning is highly complex, it requires a deep understanding of how machine learning systems operate and good intuitions about the data itself, the domain from which data is drawn (e.g. Supply Chain) and what downstream problems might be caused by poor data quality.</p>
<p>A consequence of these two reasons, data cleaning seems difficult to formulate into a readily teachable set of principles. As a result, it is heavily neglected in courses on machine learning and data science. Despite data being half the equation, most University courses spend little to no time on its challenges.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, talking to data modelling scientists. Most say they spend 80% of their time acquiring and cleaning data. This is precipitating what I refer to as the “data crisis”. This is an analogy with software. The “software crisis” was the phenomenon of inability to deliver software solutions due to increasing complexity of implementation. There was no single shot solution for the software crisis, it involved better practice (scrum, test orientated development, sprints, code review), improved programming paradigms (object orientated, functional) and better tools (CVS, then SVN, then git).</p>

<p>However, these challenges aren't new, they are merely taking a different form. From the computer's perspective software <em>is</em> data. The first wave of the data crisis was known as the <em>software crisis</em>.</p>
<h3 id="the-software-crisis">The Software Crisis</h3>
<p>In the late sixties early software programmers made note of the increasing costs of software development and termed the challenges associated with it as the &quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_crisis">Software Crisis</a>&quot;. Edsger Dijkstra referred to the crisis in his 1972 Turing Award winner's address.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an equally gigantic problem.</p>
<p>Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002), The Humble Programmer</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but data quality is often poor. What we need is cheap high-quality data. That implies that we develop processes for improving and verifying data quality that are efficient.</p>
<p>There would seem to be two ways for improving efficiency. Firstly, we should not duplicate work. Secondly, where possible we should automate work.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I term &quot;The Data Crisis&quot; is the modern equivalent of this problem. The quantity of modern data, and the lack of attention paid to data as it is initially &quot;laid down&quot; and the costs of data cleaning are bringing about a crisis in data-driven decision making. This crisis is at the core of the challenge of <em>technical debt</em> in machine learning <span class="citation">(Sculley et al. 2015)</span>.</p>
<p>Just as with software, the crisis is most correctly addressed by 'scaling' the manner in which we process our data. Duplication of work occurs because the value of data cleaning is not correctly recognised in management decision making processes. Automation of work is increasingly possible through techniques in &quot;artificial intelligence&quot;, but this will also require better management of the data science pipeline so that data about data science (meta-data science) can be correctly assimilated and processed. The Alan Turing institute has a program focussed on this area, <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/research_projects/artificial-intelligence-data-analytics/">AI for Data Analytics</a>.</p>
<p>Data is the new software, and the data crisis is already upon us. It is driven by the cost of cleaning data, the paucity of tools for monitoring and maintaining our deployments, the provenance of our models (e.g. with respect to the data they’re trained on).</p>
<p>Three principal changes need to occur in response. They are cultural and infrastructural.</p>
<h3 id="the-data-first-paradigm">The Data First Paradigm</h3>
<p>First of all, to excel in data driven decision making we need to move from a <em>software first</em> paradigm to a <em>data first</em> paradigm. That means refocusing on data as the product. Software is the intermediary to producing the data, and its quality standards must be maintained, but not at the expense of the data we are producing. Data cleaning and maintenance need to be prized as highly as software debugging and maintenance. Instead of <em>software</em> as a service, we should refocus around <em>data</em> as a service. This first change is a cultural change in which our teams think about their outputs in terms of data. Instead of decomposing our systems around the software components, we need to decompose them around the data generating and consuming components.<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Software first is only an intermediate step on the way to becoming <em>data first</em>. It is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for efficient machine learning systems design and deployment. We must move from <em>software orientated architecture</em> to a <em>data orientated architecture</em>.</p>
<h3 id="data-quality">Data Quality</h3>
<p>Secondly, we need to improve our language around data quality. We cannot assess the costs of improving data quality unless we generate a language around what data quality means. Data Readiness Levels<a href="#fn2" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> are an assessment of data quality that is based on the usage to which data is put.</p>
<h3 id="data-readiness-levels">Data Readiness Levels</h3>
<p><a href="http://inverseprobability.com/2017/01/12/data-readiness-levels">Data Readiness Levels</a> <span class="citation">(Lawrence 2017)</span> are an attempt to develop a language around data quality that can bridge the gap between technical solutions and decision makers such as managers and project planners. The are inspired by Technology Readiness Levels which attempt to quantify the readiness of technologies for deployment.b</p>
<h3 id="three-grades-of-data-readiness-edit">Three Grades of Data Readiness <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/three-grades-of-data-readiness.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/three-grades-of-data-readiness.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h3>
<p>Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level, three separate stages of data graduation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grade C - accessibility</li>
<li>Transition: data becomes electronically available</li>
<li>Grade B - validity</li>
<li>Transition: pose a question to the data.</li>
<li>Grade A - usability</li>
</ul>
<p>The important definitions are at the transition. The move from Grade C data to Grade B data is delimited by the <em>electronic availability</em> of the data. The move from Grade B to Grade A data is delimited by posing a question or task to the data <span class="citation">(Lawrence 2017)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Build a shared understanding of the language of data readiness levels for use in planning documents and costing of data cleaning and the benefits of reusing cleaned data.</p>
<h3 id="move-beyond-software-engineering-to-data-engineering">Move Beyond Software Engineering to Data Engineering</h3>
<p>Thirdly, we need to improve our mental model of the separation of data science from applied science. A common trap in our thinking around data is to see data science (and data engineering, data preparation) as a sub-set of the software engineer’s or applied scientist’s skill set. As a result, we recruit and deploy the wrong type of resource. Data preparation and question formulation is superficially similar to both because of the need for programming skills, but the day to day problems faced are very different.</p>

<p>One challenge for existing information technology professionals is realizing the extent to which a software ecosystem based on data differs from a classical ecosystem. In particular, by ingesting data we bring unknowns/uncontrollables into our decision-making system. This presents opportunity for adversarial exploitation and unforeseen operation.</p>
<p>You can also check my blog post on <a href="http://inverseprobability.com/2017/03/14/data-science-as-debugging">&quot;Data Science as Debugging&quot;</a>..</p>
<p>Starting with the analysis of a data set, the nature of data science is somewhat difference from classical software engineering.</p>
<p>One analogy I find helpful for understanding the depth of change we need is the following. Imagine as a software engineer, you find a USB stick on the ground. And for some reason you <em>know</em> that on that USB stick is a particular API call that will enable you to make a significant positive difference on a business problem. You don't know which of the many library functions on the USB stick are the ones that will help. And it could be that some of those library functions will hinder, perhaps because they are just inappropriate or perhaps because they have been placed there maliciously. The most secure thing to do would be to <em>not</em> introduce this code into your production system at all. But what if your manager told you to do so, how would you go about incorporating this code base?</p>
<p>The answer is <em>very</em> carefully. You would have to engage in a process more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into this line of code than any line of code you have written before.</p>
<p>An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the nature of the code base is understood, software tests to verify it also need to be constructed. At the end of all your work, the lines of software you write to actually interact with the software on the USB stick are likely to be minimal. But more thought would be put into those lines than perhaps any other lines of code in the system.</p>
<p>Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production system, it needs to be deployed in an environment that monitors it. We cannot rely on an individual’s decision making to ensure the quality of all our systems. We need to create an environment that includes quality controls, checks and bounds, tests, all designed to ensure that assumptions made about this foreign code base are remaining valid.</p>
<p>This situation is akin to what we are doing when we incorporate data in our production systems. When we are consuming data from others, we cannot assume that it has been produced in alignment with our goals for our own systems. Worst case, it may have been adversarially produced. A further challenge is that data is dynamic. So, in effect, the code on the USB stick is evolving over time.</p>
<p>It might see that this process is easy to formalize now, we simply need to check what the formal software engineering process is for debugging, because that is the current software engineering activity that data science is closest to. But when we look for a formalization of debugging, we find that there is none. Indeed, modern software engineering mainly focusses on ensuring that code is written without bugs in the first place.</p>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Anecdotally, resolving a machine learning challenge requires 80% of the resource to be focused on the data and perhaps 20% to be focused on the model. But many companies are too keen to employ machine learning engineers who focus on the models, not the data. We should change our hiring priorities and training. Universities cannot provide the understanding of how to data-wrangle. Companies must fill this gap.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Recommendation</strong>: We need to share best practice around data deployment across our teams. We should make best use of our processes where applicable, but we need to develop them to become <em>data first</em> organizations. Data needs to be cleaned at <em>output</em> not at <em>input</em>.</p>
<h2 id="outlook-for-machine-learning">Outlook for Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Machine learning has risen to prominence as an approach to <em>scaling</em> our activities. For us to continue to automate in the manner we have over the last two decades, we need to make more use of computer-based automation. Machine learning is allowing us to automate processes that were out of reach before.</p>

<p>In a streaming architecture we shift from management of services, to management of data streams. Instead of worrying about availability of the services we shift to worrying about the quality of the data those services are producing.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-system">Streaming System</h2>
<p>Characteristics of a streaming system include a move from <em>pull</em> updates to <em>push</em> updates, i.e. the computation is driven by a change in the input data rather than the service calling for input data when it decides to run a computation. Streaming systems operate on 'rows' of the data rather than 'columns'. This is because the full column isn't normally available as it changes over time. As an important design principle, the services themselves are stateless, they take their state from the streaming ecosystem. This ensures the inputs and outputs of given computations are easy to declare. As a result, persistence of the data is also handled by the streaming ecosystem and decisions around data retention or recomputation can be taken at the systems level rather than the component level.</p>
<h2 id="apache-flink-edit">Apache Flink <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/apache-flink.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_data-science/includes/apache-flink.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Flink">Apache Flink</a> is a stream processing framework. Flink is a foundation for event driven processing. This gives a high throughput and low latency framework that operates on dataflows.</p>
<p>Data storage is handled by other systems such as Apache Kafka or AWS Kinesis.</p>
<pre><code>stream.join(otherStream)
    .where(&lt;KeySelector&gt;)
    .equalTo(&lt;KeySelector&gt;)
    .window(&lt;WindowAssigner&gt;)
    .apply(&lt;JoinFunction&gt;)</code></pre>
<p>Apache Flink allows operations on streams. For example, the join operation above. In a traditional data base management system, this join operation may be written in SQL and called on demand. In a streaming ecosystem, computations occur as and when the streams update.</p>
<p>The join is handled by the ecosystem surrounding the business logic.</p>
<h2 id="trading-system">Trading System</h2>
<p>As a simple example we'll consider a high frequency trading system. Anne wishes to build a share trading system. She has access to a high frequency trading system which provides prices and allows trades at millisecond intervals. She wishes to build an automated trading system.</p>
<p>Let's assume that price trading data is available as a data stream. But the price now is not the only information that Anne needs, she needs an estimate of the price in the future.</p>

<p>Figure: Anne has access to the share prices in the black stream but not in the blue stream. A hypothetical stream is the stream of future prices. Anne can define this hypothetical under constraints (latency, input etc). The need for a model is now exposed in the software infrastructure</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="hypothetical-streams">Hypothetical Streams</h2>
<p>We'll call the future price a hypothetical stream.</p>
<p>A hypothetical stream is a desired stream of information which cannot be directly accessed. The lack of direct access may be because the events happen in the future, or there may be some latency between the event and the availability of the data.</p>
<p>Any hypothetical stream will only be provided as a prediction, ideally with an error bar.</p>
<p>The nature of the hypothetical Anne needs is dependent on her decision-making process. In Anne's case it will depend over what period she is expecting her returns. In MDOP Anne specifies a hypothetical that is derived from the pricing stream.</p>
<p>It is not the price stream directly, but Anne looks for <em>future</em> predictions from the price stream, perhaps for price in <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> days' time.</p>
<p>At this stage, this stream is merely typed as a hypothetical.</p>
<p>There are constraints on the hypothetical, they include: the <em>input</em> information, the upper limit of latency between input and prediction, and the decision Anne needs to make (how far ahead, what her upside, downside risks are). These three constraints mean that we can only recover an approximation to the hypothetical.</p>
<h2 id="hypothetical-advantage">Hypothetical Advantage</h2>
<p>What is the advantage to defining things in this way? By defining, clearly, the two streams as real and hypothetical variants of each other, we now enable automation of the deployment and any redeployment process. The hypothetical can be <em>instantiated</em> against the real, and design criteria can be constantly evaluated triggering retraining when necessary.</p>
<h2 id="ride-sharing-system">Ride Sharing System</h2>
<p>As a second example, we'll consider a ride sharing app.</p>
<p>Anne is on her way home now; she wishes to hail a car using a ride sharing app.</p>
<p>The app is designed in the following way. On opening her app Anne is notified about driverss in the nearby neighborhood. She is given an estimate of the time a ride may take to come.</p>
<p>Given this information about driver availability, Anne may feel encouraged to enter a destination. Given this destination, a price estimate can be given. This price is conditioned on other riders that may wish to go in the same direction, but the price estimate needs to be made before the user agrees to the ride.</p>
<p>Business customer service constraints dictate that this price may not change after Anne's order is confirmed.</p>
<p>In this simple system, several decisions are being made, each of them on the basis of a hypothetical.</p>
<p>When Anne calls for a ride, she is provided with an estimate based on the expected time a ride can be with her. But this estimate is made without knowing where Anne wants to go. There are constraints on drivers imposed by regional boundaries, reaching the end of their shift, or their current passengers mean that this estimate can only be a best guess.</p>
<p>This best guess may well be driven by previous data.</p>

<p>Figure: Data-oriented programing. There is a requirement for an estimate of the driver allocation to give a rough cost estimate before the user has confirmed the ride. In data-oriented programming, this is achieved through declaring a hypothetical stream which approximates the true driver allocation, but with restricted input information and constraints on the computational latency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the ride sharing system, we start to see a common issue with a more complex algorithmic decision-making system. Several decisions are being made multilple times. Let's look at the decisions we need along with some design criteria.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Car Availability: Estimate time to arrival for Anne's ride using Anne's location and local available car locations. Latency 50 milliseconds</li>
<li>Cost Estimate: Estimate cost for journey using Anne's destination, location and local available car current destinations and availability. Latency 50 milliseconds</li>
<li>Driver Allocation: Allocate car to minimize transport cost to destination. Latency 2 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we need:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>a hypothetical to estimate availability. It is constrained by lacking destination information and a low latency requirement.</li>
<li>a hypothetical to estimate cost. It is constrained by low latency requirement and</li>
</ol>
<p>Simultaneously, drivers in this data ecosystem have an app which notifies them about new jobs and recommends them where to go.</p>
<p>Further advantages. Strategies for data retention (when to snapshot) can be set globally.</p>
<p>A few decisions need to be made in this system. First of all, when the user opens the app, the estimate of the time to the nearest ride may need to be computed quickly, to avoid latency in the service.</p>
<p>This may require a quick estimate of the ride availability.</p>
<h2 id="information-dynamics">Information Dynamics</h2>
<p>With all the second guessing within a complex automated decision-making system, there are potential problems with information dynamics, the 'closed loop' problem, where the sub-systems are being approximated (second guessing) and predictions downstream are being affected.</p>
<p>This leads to the need for a closed loop analysis, for example, see the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/">&quot;Closed Loop Data Science&quot;</a> project led by Rod Murray-Smith at Glasgow.</p>
<p>Our aim is to release our first version of a data-oriented programming environment by end of June 2019 (pending internal approval).</p>

<p>We operate in a technologically evolving environment. Machine learning is becoming a key coponent in our decision-making capabilities, our intelligence and strategic command. However, technology drove changes in battlefield strategy. From the stalemate of the first world war to the tank-dominated Blitzkrieg of the second, to the asymmetric warfare of the present. Our technology, tactics and strategies are also constantly evolving. Machine learning is part of that evolution solution, but the main challenge is not to become so fixated on the tactics of today that we miss the evolution of strategy that the technology is suggesting.</p>
<p>Data oriented programming offers a set of development methodologies which ensure that the system designer considers what decisions are required, how they will be made, and critically, declares this within the system architecture.</p>
