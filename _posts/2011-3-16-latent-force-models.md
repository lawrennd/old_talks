title: Latent Force Models
abstract: Physics based approaches to data modeling involve constructing an accurate
  mechanistic model of data, often based on differential equations. Machine learning
  approaches are typically data driven—perhaps through regularized function approximation.
  These two approaches to data modeling are often seen as polar opposites, but in
  reality they are two different ends to a spectrum of approaches we might take. In
  this talk we introduce latent force models. Latent force models are a new approach
  to data representation that model data through unknown forcing functions that drive
  differential equation models.  By treating the unknown forcing functions with Gaussian
  process priors we can create probabilistic models that exhibit particular physical
  characteristics of interest, for example, in dynamical systems resonance and inertia.
  This allows us to perform a synthesis of the data driven and physical modeling paradigms.
  We will show applications of these models in systems biology and (given time) modelling
  of human motion capture data.
