title: "Panel 2: AI for Good Business: Using Information Better and More
Responsibly"
venue: "Jawdrop Summit, Imperial College, White City Campus"
abstract: "<p>The rapid advances of AI and ML are now embedded in many
aspects of human life. Discussions of the ethical implications have
lagged behind the rapid pace of the technological advances and
unintended consequences are only now beginning to unfold. The panel
addressed questions such as how we can harness explainable AI, mitigate
for human biases in the data collection or analysis and use
privacy-preserving algorithms to use AI and ML towards a fairer and more
equitable world.</p>"
