venue: "NIPS Tutorial 2017"
abstract: "<p>Neural network models are algorithmically simple, but mathematically complex. Gaussian process models are mathematically simple, but algorithmically complex. In this tutorial we will explore Deep Gaussian Process models. They bring advantages in their mathematical simplicity but are challenging in their algorithmic complexity. We will give an overview of Gaussian processes and highlight the algorithmic approximations that allow us to stack Gaussian process models: they are based on variational methods. In the last part of the tutorial will explore a use case exemplar: uncertainty quantification. We end with open questions.</p>"

<h2 id="what-is-machine-learning">What is Machine Learning?</h2>
<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a combination of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{data} + \text{model} \xrightarrow{\text{compute}} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> a function which is used to make the predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness, spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> a function which defines the cost of misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world's generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and the objectie function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the acdemic field of machine learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring different types of models and data together.</p>
<p>A useful reference for state of the art in machine learning is the UK Royal Society Report, <a href="https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf">Machine Learning: Power and Promise of Computers that Learn by Example</a>.</p>

<h3 id="artificial-intelligence">Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<h3 id="uncertainty">Uncertainty</h3>
<p>In practice, we normally also have uncertainty associated with these functions. Uncertainty in the prediction function arises from</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>scarcity of training data and</li>
<li>mismatch between the set of prediction functions we choose and all possible prediction functions.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also challenges around specification of the objective function, but for we will save those for another day. For the moment, let us focus on the prediction function.</p>
<h3 id="neural-networks-and-prediction-functions">Neural Networks and Prediction Functions</h3>
<p>Neural networks are adaptive non-linear function models. Originally, they were studied (by McCulloch and Pitts <span class="citation">(McCulloch and Pitts, 1943)</span>) as simple models for neurons, but over the last decade they have become popular because they are a flexible approach to modelling complex data. A particular characteristic of neural network models is that they can be composed to form highly complex functions which encode many of our expectations of the real world. They allow us to encode our assumptions about how the world works.</p>
<p>We will return to composition later, but for the moment, let's focus on a one hidden layer neural network. We are interested in the prediction function, so we'll ignore the objective function (which is often called an error function) for the moment, and just describe the mathematical object of interest</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\mappingFunction(\inputVector) = \mappingMatrix^\top \activationVector(\mappingMatrixTwo, \inputVector)
\]</span></p>
<p>Where in this case <span class="math inline">\(\mappingFunction(\cdot)\)</span> is a scalar function with vector inputs, and <span class="math inline">\(\activationVector(\cdot)\)</span> is a vector function with vector inputs. The dimensionality of the vector function is known as the number of hidden units, or the number of neurons. The elements of this vector function are known as the <em>activation</em> function of the neural network and <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrixTwo\)</span> are the parameters of the activation functions.</p>
<h3 id="relations-with-classical-statistics">Relations with Classical Statistics</h3>
<p>In statistics activation functions are traditionally known as <em>basis functions</em>. And we would think of this as a <em>linear model</em>. It's doesn't make linear predictions, but it's linear because in statistics estimation focuses on the parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrix\)</span>, not the parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrixTwo\)</span>. The linear model terminology refers to the fact that the model is <em>linear in the parameters</em>, but it is <em>not</em> linear in the data unless the activation functions are chosen to be linear.</p>
<h3 id="adaptive-basis-functions">Adaptive Basis Functions</h3>
<p>The first difference in the (early) neural network literature to the classical statistical literature is the decision to optimize these parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrixTwo\)</span>, as well as the parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrix\)</span> (which would normally be denoted in statistics by <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)</span>)<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>.</p>
<p>In this tutorial, we're going to go revisit that decision, and follow the path of Radford Neal <span class="citation">(Neal, 1994)</span> who, inspired by work of David MacKay <span class="citation">(MacKay, 1992)</span> and others did his PhD thesis on Bayesian Neural Networks. If we take a Bayesian approach to parameter inference (note I am using inference here in the classical sense, not in the sense of prediction of test data, which seems to be a newer usage), then we don't wish to fit parameters at all, rather we wish to integrate them away and understand the family of functions that the model describes.</p>
<h3 id="probabilistic-modelling">Probabilistic Modelling</h3>
<p>This Bayesian approach is designed to deal with uncertainty arising from fitting our prediction function to the data we have, a reduced data set.</p>
<p>The Bayesian approach can be derived from a broader understanding of what our objective is. If we accept that we can jointly represent all things that happen in the world with a probability distribution, then we can interogate that probability to make predictions. So, if we are interested in predictions, <span class="math inline">\(\dataScalar_*\)</span> at future points input locations of interest, <span class="math inline">\(\inputVector_*\)</span> given previously training data, <span class="math inline">\(\dataVector\)</span> and corresponding inputs, <span class="math inline">\(\inputMatrix\)</span>, then we are really interogating the following probability density, <span class="math display">\[
p(\dataScalar_*|\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector_*),
\]</span> there is nothing controversial here, as long as you accept that you have a good joint model of the world around you that relates test data to training data, <span class="math inline">\(p(\dataScalar_*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector_*)\)</span> then this conditional distribution can be recovered through standard rules of probability (<span class="math inline">\(\text{data} + \text{model} \rightarrow \text{prediction}\)</span>).</p>
<p>We can construct this joint density through the use of the following decomposition: <span class="math display">\[
p(\dataScalar_*|\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector_*) = \int p(\dataScalar_*|\inputVector_*, \mappingMatrix) p(\mappingMatrix | \dataVector, \inputMatrix) \text{d} \mappingMatrix
\]</span></p>
<p>where, for convenience, we are assuming <em>all</em> the parameters of the model are now represented by <span class="math inline">\(\parameterVector\)</span> (which contains <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrix\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrixTwo\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(p(\parameterVector | \dataVector, \inputMatrix)\)</span> is recognised as the posterior density of the parameters given data and <span class="math inline">\(p(\dataScalar_*|\inputVector_*, \parameterVector)\)</span> is the <em>likelihood</em> of an individual test data point given the parameters.</p>
<p>The likelihood of the data is normally assumed to be independent across the parameters, <span class="math display">\[
p(\dataVector|\inputMatrix, \mappingMatrix) \prod_{i=1}^\numData p(\dataScalar_i|\inputVector_i, \mappingMatrix),\]</span></p>
<p>and if that is so, it is easy to extend our predictions across all future, potential, locations, <span class="math display">\[
p(\dataVector_*|\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputMatrix_*) = \int p(\dataVector_*|\inputMatrix_*, \parameterVector) p(\parameterVector | \dataVector, \inputMatrix) \text{d} \parameterVector.
\]</span></p>
<p>The likelihood is also where the <em>prediction function</em> is incorporated. For example in the regression case, we consider an objective based around the Gaussian density, <span class="math display">\[
p(\dataScalar_i | \mappingFunction(\inputVector_i)) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \dataStd^2}} \exp\left(-\frac{\left(\dataScalar_i - \mappingFunction(\inputVector_i)\right)^2}{2\dataStd^2}\right)
\]</span></p>
<p>In short, that is the classical approach to probabilistic inference, and all approaches to Bayesian neural networks fall within this path. For a deep probabilistic model, we can simply take this one stage further and place a probability distribution over the input locations, <span class="math display">\[
p(\dataVector_*|\dataVector) = \int p(\dataVector_*|\inputMatrix_*, \parameterVector) p(\parameterVector | \dataVector, \inputMatrix) p(\inputMatrix) p(\inputMatrix_*) \text{d} \parameterVector \text{d} \inputMatrix \text{d}\inputMatrix_*
\]</span> and we have <em>unsupervised learning</em> (from where we can get deep generative models).</p>
<h3 id="graphical-models">Graphical Models</h3>
<p>One way of representing a joint distribution is to consider conditional dependencies between data. Conditional dependencies allow us to factorize the distribution. For example, a Markov chain is a factorization of a distribution into components that represent the conditional relationships between points that are neighboring, often in time or space. It can be decomposed in the following form. <span class="math display">\[p(\dataVector) = p(\dataScalar_\numData | \dataScalar_{\numData-1}) p(\dataScalar_{\numData-1}|\dataScalar_{\numData-2}) \dots p(\dataScalar_{2} | \dataScalar_{1})\]</span></p>

<p>By specifying conditional independencies we can reduce the parameterization required for our data, instead of directly specifying the parameters of the joint distribution, we can specify each set of parameters of the conditonal independently. This can also give an advantage in terms of interpretability. Understanding a conditional independence structure gives a structured understanding of data. If developed correctly, according to causal methodology, it can even inform how we should intervene in the system to drive a desired result <span class="citation">(Pearl, 1995)</span>.</p>
<p>However, a challenge arise when the data becomes more complex. Consider the graphical model shown below, used to predict the perioperative risk of <em>C Difficile</em> infection following colon surgery <span class="citation">(Steele et al., 2012)</span>.</p>
<p><img class="negate" src="../slides/diagrams/bayes-net-diagnosis.png" width="40%" align="center" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></p>
<p>To capture the complexity in the interelationship between the data the graph becomes more complex, and less interpretable.</p>
<h3 id="performing-inference">Performing Inference</h3>
<p>As far as combining our data and our model to form our prediction, the devil is in the detail. While everything is easy to write in terms of probability densities, as we move from <span class="math inline">\(\text{data}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{model}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\text{prediction}\)</span> there is that simple <span class="math inline">\(\xrightarrow{\text{compute}}\)</span> sign, which is now burying a wealth of difficulties. Each integral sign above is a high dimensional integral which will typically need approximation. Approximations also come with computational demands. As we consider more complex classes of functions, the challenges around the integrals become harder and prediction of future test data given our model and the data becomes so involved as to be impractical or impossible.</p>
<p>Statisticians realized these challenges early on, indeed, so early that they were actually physicists, both Laplace and Gauss worked on models such as this, in Gauss's case he made his career on prediction of the location of the lost planet (later reclassified as a asteroid, then dwarf planet), Ceres. Gauss and Laplace made use of maximum a posteriori estimates for simplifying their computations and Laplace developed Laplace's method (and invented the Gaussian density) to expand around that mode. But classical statistics needs better guarantees around model performance and interpretation, and as a result has focussed more on the <em>linear</em> model implied by <span class="math display">\[
  \mappingFunction(\inputVector) = \left.\mappingVector^{(2)}\right.^\top \activationVector(\mappingMatrix_1, \inputVector)
  \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
  \mappingVector^{(2)} \sim \gaussianSamp{\zerosVector}{\covarianceMatrix}.
  \]</span></p>
<p>The Gaussian likelihood given above implies that the data observation is related to the function by noise corruption so we have, <span class="math display">\[
  \dataScalar_i = \mappingFunction(\inputVector_i) + \noiseScalar_i,
  \]</span> where <span class="math display">\[
  \noiseScalar_i \sim \gaussianSamp{0}{\dataStd^2}
  \]</span> and while normally integrating over high dimensional parameter vectors is highly complex, here it is <em>trivial</em>. That is because of a property of the multivariate Gaussian.</p>
<h3 id="multivariate-gaussian-properties">Multivariate Gaussian Properties</h3>
<p>Gaussian processes are initially of interest because</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>linear Gaussian models are easier to deal with</li>
<li>Even the parameters <em>within</em> the process can be handled, by considering a particular limit.</li>
</ol>
<p>Let's first of all review the properties of the multivariate Gaussian distribution that make linear Gaussian models easier to deal with. We'll return to the, perhaps surprising, result on the parameters within the nonlinearity, <span class="math inline">\(\parameterVector\)</span>, shortly.</p>
<p>To work with linear Gaussian models, to find the marginal likelihood all you need to know is the following rules. If <span class="math display">\[
\dataVector = \mappingMatrix \inputVector + \noiseVector,
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\dataVector\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\inputVector\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\noiseVector\)</span> are vectors and we assume that <span class="math inline">\(\inputVector\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\noiseVector\)</span> are drawn from multivariate Gaussians, <span class="math display">\[\begin{align}
\inputVector &amp; \sim \gaussianSamp{\meanVector}{\covarianceMatrix}\\
\noiseVector &amp; \sim \gaussianSamp{\zerosVector}{\covarianceMatrixTwo}
\end{align}\]</span> then we know that <span class="math inline">\(\dataVector\)</span> is also drawn from a multivariate Gaussian with, <span class="math display">\[
\dataVector \sim \gaussianSamp{\mappingMatrix\meanVector}{\mappingMatrix\covarianceMatrix\mappingMatrix^\top + \covarianceMatrixTwo}.
\]</span> With apprioriately defined covariance, <span class="math inline">\(\covarianceTwoMatrix\)</span>, this is actually the marginal likelihood for Factor Analysis, or Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis <span class="citation">(Tipping and Bishop, 1999)</span>, because we integrated out the inputs (or <em>latent</em> variables they would be called in that case).</p>
<p>However, we are focussing on what happens in models which are non-linear in the inputs, whereas the above would be <em>linear</em> in the inputs. To consider these, we introduce a matrix, called the design matrix. We set each activation function computed at each data point to be <span class="math display">\[
\activationScalar_{i,j} = \activationScalar(\mappingVector^{(1)}_{j}, \inputVector_{i})
\]</span> and define the matrix of activations (known as the <em>design matrix</em> in statistics) to be, <span class="math display">\[
\activationMatrix = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\activationScalar_{1, 1} &amp; \activationScalar_{1, 2} &amp; \dots &amp; \activationScalar_{1, \numHidden} \\
\activationScalar_{1, 2} &amp; \activationScalar_{1, 2} &amp; \dots &amp; \activationScalar_{1, \numData} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
\activationScalar_{\numData, 1} &amp; \activationScalar_{\numData, 2} &amp; \dots &amp; \activationScalar_{\numData, \numHidden}
\end{bmatrix}.
\]</span> By convention this matrix always has <span class="math inline">\(\numData\)</span> rows and <span class="math inline">\(\numHidden\)</span> columns, now if we define the vector of all noise corruptions, <span class="math inline">\(\noiseVector = \left[\noiseScalar_1, \dots \noiseScalar_\numData\right]^\top\)</span>.</p>
<h3 id="matrix-representation-of-a-neural-network">Matrix Representation of a Neural Network</h3>
<p><span class="math display">\[\dataScalar\left(\inputVector\right) = \activationVector\left(\inputVector\right)^\top \mappingVector + \noiseScalar\]</span></p>
<div class="incremental">
<p><span class="math display">\[\dataVector = \activationMatrix\mappingVector + \noiseVector\]</span></p>
</div>
<div class="incremental">
<p><span class="math display">\[\noiseVector \sim \gaussianSamp{\zerosVector}{\dataStd^2\eye}\]</span></p>
<p>{ If we define the prior distribution over the vector <span class="math inline">\(\mappingVector\)</span> to be Gaussian,} <span class="math display">\[
\mappingVector \sim \gaussianSamp{\zerosVector}{\alpha\eye},
\]</span></p>
<p>{ then we can use rules of multivariate Gaussians to see that,} <span class="math display">\[
\dataVector \sim \gaussianSamp{\zerosVector}{\alpha \activationMatrix \activationMatrix^\top + \dataStd^2 \eye}.
\]</span></p>
<p>In other words, our training data is distributed as a multivariate Gaussian, with zero mean and a covariance given by <span class="math display">\[
\kernelMatrix = \alpha \activationMatrix \activationMatrix^\top + \dataStd^2 \eye.
\]</span></p>
<p>This is an <span class="math inline">\(\numData \times \numData\)</span> size matrix. Its elements are in the form of a function. The maths shows that any element, index by <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, is a function <em>only</em> of inputs associated with data points <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\dataVector_i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\dataVector_j\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\kernel_{i,j} = \kernel\left(\inputVector_i, \inputVector_j\right)\)</span></p>
<p>If we look at the portion of this function associated only with <span class="math inline">\(\mappingFunction(\cdot)\)</span>, i.e. we remove the noise, then we can write down the covariance associated with our neural network, <span class="math display">\[
\kernel_\mappingFunction\left(\inputVector_i, \inputVector_j\right) = \alpha \activationVector\left(\mappingMatrix_1, \inputVector_i\right)^\top \activationVector\left(\mappingMatrix_1, \inputVector_j\right)
\]</span> so the elements of the covariance or <em>kernel</em> matrix are formed by inner products of the rows of the <em>design matrix</em>.</p>
<p>This is the essence of a Gaussian process. Instead of making assumptions about our density over each data point, <span class="math inline">\(\dataScalar_i\)</span> as i.i.d. we make a joint Gaussian assumption over our data. The covariance matrix is now a function of both the parameters of the activation function, <span class="math inline">\(\mappingMatrixTwo\)</span>, and the input variables, <span class="math inline">\(\inputMatrix\)</span>. This comes about through integrating out the parameters of the model, <span class="math inline">\(\mappingVector\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can basically put anything inside the basis functions, and many people do. These can be deep kernels <span class="citation">(Cho and Saul, 2009)</span> or we can learn the parameters of a convolutional neural network inside there.</p>
<p>Viewing a neural network in this way is also what allows us to beform sensible <em>batch</em> normalizations <span class="citation">(Ioffe and Szegedy, 2015)</span>.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="non-degenerate-gaussian-processes">Non-degenerate Gaussian Processes</h3>
<p>The process described above is degenerate. The covariance function is of rank at most <span class="math inline">\(\numHidden\)</span> and since the theoretical amount of data could always increase <span class="math inline">\(\numData \rightarrow \infty\)</span>, the covariance function is not full rank. This means as we increase the amount of data to infinity, there will come a point where we can't normalize the process because the multivariate Gaussian has the form, <span class="math display">\[
\gaussianDist{\mappingFunctionVector}{\zerosVector}{\kernelMatrix} = \frac{1}{\left(2\pi\right)^{\frac{\numData}{2}}\det{\kernelMatrix}^\frac{1}{2}} \exp\left(-\frac{\mappingFunctionVector^\top\kernelMatrix \mappingFunctionVector}{2}\right)
\]</span> and a non-degenerate kernel matrix leads to <span class="math inline">\(\det{\kernelMatrix} = 0\)</span> defeating the normalization (it's equivalent to finding a projection in the high dimensional Gaussian where the variance of the the resulting univariate Gaussian is zero, i.e. there is a null space on the covariance, or alternatively you can imagine there are one or more directions where the Gaussian has become the delta function).</p>
<p>In the machine learning field, it was Radford Neal <span class="citation">(Neal, 1994)</span> that realized the potential of the next step. In his 1994 thesis, he was considering Bayesian neural networks, of the type we described above, and in considered what would happen if you took the number of hidden nodes, or neurons, to infinity, i.e. <span class="math inline">\(\numHidden \rightarrow \infty\)</span>.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~radford/ftp/thesis.pdf"><img class="" src="../slides/diagrams/neal-infinite-priors.png" width="80%" align="" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></a></p>
<p><em>Page 37 of Radford Neal's 1994 thesis</em></p>
<p>In loose terms, what Radford considers is what happens to the elements of the covariance function, <span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align*}
  \kernel_\mappingFunction\left(\inputVector_i, \inputVector_j\right) &amp; = \alpha \activationVector\left(\mappingMatrix_1, \inputVector_i\right)^\top \activationVector\left(\mappingMatrix_1, \inputVector_j\right)\\
  &amp; = \alpha \sum_k \activationScalar\left(\mappingVector^{(1)}_k, \inputVector_i\right) \activationScalar\left(\mappingVector^{(1)}_k, \inputVector_j\right)
  \end{align*}
  \]</span> if instead of considering a finite number you sample infinitely many of these activation functions, sampling parameters from a prior density, <span class="math inline">\(p(\mappingVectorTwo)\)</span>, for each one, <span class="math display">\[
\kernel_\mappingFunction\left(\inputVector_i, \inputVector_j\right) = \alpha \int \activationScalar\left(\mappingVector^{(1)}, \inputVector_i\right) \activationScalar\left(\mappingVector^{(1)}, \inputVector_j\right) p(\mappingVector^{(1)}) \text{d}\mappingVector^{(1)}
\]</span> And that's not <em>only</em> for Gaussian <span class="math inline">\(p(\mappingVectorTwo)\)</span>. In fact this result holds for a range of activations, and a range of prior densities because of the <em>central limit theorem</em>.</p>
<p>To write it in the form of a probabilistic program, as long as the distribution for <span class="math inline">\(\phi_i\)</span> implied by this short probabilistic program, <span class="math display">\[
  \begin{align*}
  \mappingVectorTwo &amp; \sim p(\cdot)\\
  \phi_i &amp; = \activationScalar\left(\mappingVectorTwo, \inputVector_i\right), 
  \end{align*}
  \]</span> has finite variance, then the result of taking the number of hidden units to infinity, with appropriate scaling, is also a Gaussian process.</p>
<h3 id="further-reading">Further Reading</h3>
<p>To understand this argument in more detail, I highly recommend reading chapter 2 of Neal's thesis, which remains easy to read and clear today. Indeed, for readers interested in Bayesian neural networks, both Raford Neal's and David MacKay's PhD thesis <span class="citation">(MacKay, 1992)</span> remain essential reading. Both theses embody a clarity of thought, and an ability to weave together threads from different fields that was the business of machine learning in the 1990s. Radford and David were also pioneers in making their software widely available and publishing material on the web.</p>

<p>The exponentiated quadratic covariance, also known as the Gaussian covariance or the RBF covariance and the squared exponential. Covariance between two points is related to the negative exponential of the squared distnace between those points. This covariance function can be derived in a few different ways: as the infinite limit of a radial basis function neural network, as diffusion in the heat equation, as a Gaussian filter in <em>Fourier space</em> or as the composition as a series of linear filters applied to a base function.</p>
The covariance takes the following form, <span class="math display">\[
\kernelScalar(\inputVector, \inputVector^\prime) = \alpha \exp\left(-\frac{\ltwoNorm{\inputVector - \inputVector^\prime}^2}{2\ell^2}\right)
\]</span> where <span class="math inline">\(\ell\)</span> is the <em>length scale</em> or <em>time scale</em> of the process and <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> represents the overall process variance.

<p>Things to notice about the data include the outlier in 1904, in this year, the olympics was in St Louis, USA. Organizational problems and challenges with dust kicked up by the cars following the race meant that participants got lost, and only very few participants completed.</p>
<p>More recent years see more consistently quick marathons.</p>
<p>Our first objective will be to perform a Gaussian process fit to the data, we'll do this using the <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">GPy software</a>.</p>

<p>The first command sets up the model, then</p>

<p>optimizes the parameters of the covariance function and the noise level of the model. Once the fit is complete, we'll try creating some test points, and computing the output of the GP model in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the posterior functions between 1870 and 2030.

<p>In the fit we see that the error bars (coming mainly from the noise variance) are quite large. This is likely due to the outlier point in 1904, ignoring that point we can see that a tighter fit is obtained. To see this making a version of the model, <code>m_clean</code>, where that point is removed.</p>
<pre><code>x_clean=np.vstack((x[0:2, :], x[3:, :]))

<p>Data is fine for answering very specific questions, like &quot;Who won the Olympic Marathon in 2012?&quot;, because we have that answer stored, however, we are not given the answer to many other questions. For example, Alan Turing was a formidable marathon runner, in 1946 he ran a time 2 hours 46 minutes (just under four minutes per kilometer, faster than I and most of the other <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/sheffieldhallam/">Endcliffe Park Run</a> runners can do 5 km). What is the probability he would have won an Olympics if one had been held in 1946?</p>

<h3 id="why-deep">Why Deep?</h3>
<p>If the result of composing many functions together is simply another function, then why do we bother? The key point is that we can change the class of functions we are modeling by composing in this manner. A Gaussian process is specifying a prior over functions, and one with a number of elegant properties. For example, the derivative process (if it exists) of a Gaussian process is also Gaussian distributed. That makes it easy to assimilate, for example, derivative observations. But that also might raise some alarm bells. That implies that the <em>marginal derivative distribution</em> is also Gaussian distributed. If that's the case, then it means that functions which occasionally exhibit very large derivatives are hard to model with a Gaussian process. For example, a function with jumps in.</p>
<p>A one off discontinuity is easy to model with a Gaussian process, or even multiple discontinuities. They can be introduced in the mean function, or independence can be forced between two covariance functions that apply in different areas of the input space. But in these cases we will need to specify the number of discontinuities and where they occur. In otherwords we need to <em>parameterise</em> the discontinuities. If we do not know the number of discontinuities and don't wish to specify where they occur, i.e. if we want a non-parametric representation of discontinuities, then the standard Gaussian process doesn't help.</p>
<h3 id="stochastic-process-composition">Stochastic Process Composition</h3>
<p>The deep Gaussian process leads to <em>non-Gaussian</em> models, and non-Gaussian characteristics in the covariance function. In effect, what we are proposing is that we change the properties of the functions we are considering by *composing stochastic processes$. This is an approach to creating new stochastic processes from well known processes.</p>

<p>Things to notice about the data include the outlier in 1904, in this year, the olympics was in St Louis, USA. Organizational problems and challenges with dust kicked up by the cars following the race meant that participants got lost, and only very few participants completed.</p>
<p>More recent years see more consistently quick marathons.</p>
<p>Our first objective will be to perform a Gaussian process fit to the data, we'll do this using the <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">GPy software</a>.</p>

Once the fit is complete, we'll try creating some test points, and computing the output of the GP model in terms of the mean and standard deviation of the posterior functions between 1870 and 2030.

<p>In the fit we see that the error bars (coming mainly from the noise variance) are quite large. This is likely due to the outlier point in 1904, ignoring that point we can see that a tighter fit is obtained. To see this making a version of the model, <code>m_clean</code>, where that point is removed.</p>
<pre><code>x_clean=np.vstack((x[0:2, :], x[3:, :]))
y_clean=np.vstack((y[0:2, :], y[3:, :]))

<p>Data is fine for answering very specific questions, like &quot;Who won the Olympic Marathon in 2012?&quot;, because we have that answer stored, however, we are not given the answer to many other questions. For example, Alan Turing was a formidable marathon runner, in 1946 he ran a time 2 hours 46 minutes (just under four minutes per kilometer, faster than I and most of the other <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/sheffieldhallam/">Endcliffe Park Run</a> runners can do 5 km). What is the probability he would have won an Olympics if one had been held in 1946?</p>

<h3 id="deep-gp-fit">Deep GP Fit</h3>
<p>Let's see if a deep Gaussian process can help here. We will construct a deep Gaussian process with one hidden layer (i.e. one Gaussian process feeding into another).</p>
<p>Build a Deep GP with an additional hidden layer (one dimensional) to fit the model.</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python">hidden <span class="op">=</span> <span class="dv">1</span>

<p>Deep Gaussian process models also can require some thought in initialization. Here we choose to start by setting the noise variance to be one percent of the data variance.</p>
<p>Optimization requires moving variational parameters in the hidden layer representing the mean and variance of the expected values in that layer. Since all those values can be scaled up, and this only results in a downscaling in the output of the first GP, and a downscaling of the input length scale to the second GP. It makes sense to first of all fix the scales of the covariance function in each of the GPs.</p>
<p>Sometimes, deep Gaussian processes can find a local minima which involves increasing the noise level of one or more of the GPs. This often occurs because it allows a minimum in the KL divergence term in the lower bound on the likelihood. To avoid this minimum we habitually train with the likelihood variance (the noise on the output of the GP) fixed to some lower value for some iterations.</p>
<p>Let's create a helper function to initialize the models we use in the notebook.</p>

<p>The pinball plot shows the flow of any input ball through the deep Gaussian process. In a pinball plot a series of vertical parallel lines would indicate a purely linear function. For the olypmic marathon data we can see the first layer begins to shift from input towards the right. Note it also does so with some uncertainty (indicated by the shaded backgrounds). The second layer has less uncertainty, but bunches the inputs more strongly to the right. This input layer of uncertainty, followed by a layer that pushes inputs to the right is what gives the heteroschedastic noise.</p>

<p>Just like deep neural networks, there are some tricks to intitializing these models. The tricks we use here include some early training of the model with model parameters constrained. This gives the variational inducing parameters some scope to tighten the bound for the case where the noise variance is small and the variances of the Gaussian processes are around 1.</p>

<p>We will to illustrate different concepts of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification">Uncertainty Quantification</a> (UQ) and the role that Gaussian processes play in this field. Based on a simple simulator of a car moving between a valley and a mountain, we are going to illustrate the following concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Systems emulation</strong>. Many real world decisions are based on simulations that can be computationally very demanding. We will show how simulators can be replaced by <em>emulators</em>: Gaussian process models fitted on a few simulations that can be used to replace the <em>simulator</em>. Emulators are cheap to compute, fast to run, and always provide ways to quantify the uncertainty of how precise they are compared the original simulator.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Emulators in optimization problems</strong>. We will show how emulators can be used to optimize black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. This field is also called Bayesian Optimization and has gained an increasing relevance in machine learning as emulators can be used to optimize computer simulations (and machine learning algorithms) quite efficiently.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Multi-fidelity emulation methods</strong>. In many scenarios we have simulators of different quality about the same measure of interest. In these cases the goal is to merge all sources of information under the same model so the final emulator is cheaper and more accurate than an emulator fitted only using data from the most accurate and expensive simulator.</p></li>

<h3 id="mountain-car-simulator">Mountain Car Simulator</h3>
<p>To illustrate the above mentioned concepts we we use the <a href="https://github.com/openai/gym/wiki/MountainCarContinuous-v0">mountain car simulator</a>. This simulator is widely used in machine learning to test reinforcement learning algorithms. The goal is to define a control policy on a car whose objective is to climb a mountain. Graphically, the problem looks as follows:</p>
<p><img class="" src="../slides/diagrams/uq/mountaincar.png" width="negate" align="" style="background:none; border:none; box-shadow:none;"></p>
<p>The goal is to define a sequence of actions (push the car right or left with certain intensity) to make the car reach the flag after a number <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> of time steps.</p>
<p>At each time step <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>, the car is characterized by a vector <span class="math inline">\(\inputVector_{t} = (p_t,v_t)\)</span> of states which are respectively the the position and velocity of the car at time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>. For a sequence of states (an episode), the dynamics of the car is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\inputVector_{t+1} = \mappingFunction(\inputVector_{t},\textbf{u}_{t})\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{u}_{t}\)</span> is the value of an action force, which in this example corresponds to push car to the left (negative value) or to the right (positive value). The actions across a full episode are represented in a policy <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{u}_{t} = \pi(\inputVector_{t},\theta)\)</span> that acts according to the current state of the car and some parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>. In the following examples we will assume that the policy is linear which allows us to write <span class="math inline">\(\pi(\inputVector_{t},\theta)\)</span> as</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\pi(\inputVector,\theta)= \theta_0 + \theta_p p + \theta_vv.\]</span></p>
<p>For <span class="math inline">\(t=1,\dots,T\)</span> now given some initial state <span class="math inline">\(\inputVector_{0}\)</span> and some some values of each <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{u}_{t}\)</span>, we can <strong>simulate</strong> the full dynamics of the car for a full episode using <a href="https://gym.openai.com/envs/">Gym</a>. The values of <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{u}_{t}\)</span> are fully determined by the parameters of the linear controller.</p>
<p>After each episode of length <span class="math inline">\(T\)</span> is complete, a reward function <span class="math inline">\(R_{T}(\theta)\)</span> is computed. In the mountain car example the reward is computed as 100 for reaching the target of the hill on the right hand side, minus the squared sum of actions (a real negative to push to the left and a real positive to push to the right) from start to goal. Note that our reward depend on <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> as we make it dependent on the parameters of the linear controller.</p>

<p>Our goal in this section is to find the parameters <span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span> of the linear controller such that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\theta^* = arg \max_{\theta} R_T(\theta).\]</span></p>
<p>In this section, we directly use Bayesian optimization to solve this problem. We will use <a href="https://sheffieldml.github.io/GPyOpt/">GPyOpt</a> so we first define the objective function:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="im">import</span> mountain_car <span class="im">as</span> mc

objective <span class="op">=</span> GPyOpt.core.task.SingleObjective(obj_func)</code></pre></div>
<p>For each set of parameter values of the linear controller we can run an episode of the simulator (that we fix to have a horizon of <span class="math inline">\(T=500\)</span>) to generate the reward. Using as input the parameters of the controller and as outputs the rewards we can build a Gaussian process emulator of the reward.</p>
<p>We start defining the input space, which is three-dimensional:</p>

<p>he car can now make it to the top of the mountain! Emulating the reward function and using the EI helped as to find a linear controller that solves the problem.</p>
<h3 id="data-efficient-emulation">Data Efficient Emulation</h3>
<p>In the previous section we solved the mountain car problem by directly emulating the reward but no considerations about the dynamics <span class="math inline">\(\inputVector_{t+1} = \mappingFunction(\inputVector_{t},\textbf{u}_{t})\)</span> of the system were made. Note that we had to run 75 episodes of 500 steps each to solve the problem, which required to call the simulator <span class="math inline">\(500\times 75 =37500\)</span> times. In this section we will show how it is possible to reduce this number by building an emulator for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that can later be used to directly optimize the control.</p>
<p>The inputs of the model for the dynamics are the velocity, the position and the value of the control so create this space accordingly.</p>

<p>The outputs are the velocity and the position. Indeed our model will capture the change in position and velocity on time. That is, we will model</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta v_{t+1} = v_{t+1} - v_{t}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Delta x_{t+1} = p_{t+1} - p_{t}\]</span></p>
<p>with Gaussian processes with prior mean <span class="math inline">\(v_{t}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_{t}\)</span> respectively. As a covariance function, we use a Matern52. We need therefore two models to capture the full dynamics of the system.</p>

<p>In general we might use much smarter strategies to design our emulation of the simulator. For example, we could use the variance of the predictive distributions of the models to collect points using uncertainty sampling, which will give us a better coverage of the space. For simplicity, we move ahead with the 500 randomly selected points.</p>
<p>Now that we have a data set, we can update the emulators for the location and the velocity.</p>

<p>We can now have a look to how the emulator and the simulator match. First, we show a contour plot of the car aceleration for each pair of can position and velocity. You can use the bar bellow to play with the values of the controler to compare the emulator and the simulator.</p>

<p>We can see how the emulator is doing a fairly good job approximating the simulator. On the edges, however, it struggles to captures the dynamics of the simulator.</p>
<p>Given some input parameters of the linear controlling, how do the dynamics of the emulator and simulator match? In the following figure we show the position and velocity of the car for the 500 time steps of an episode in which the parameters of the linear controller have been fixed beforehand.

<p>We now make explicit use of the emulator, using it to replace the simulator and optimize the linear controller.

<p>And the problem is again solved, but in this case we have replaced the simulator of the car dynamics by a Gaussian process emulator that we learned by calling the simulator only 500 times. Compared to the 37500 calls that we needed when applying Bayesian optimization directly on the simulator this is a great gain.</p>
<p>In some scenarios we have simulators of the same environment that have different fidelities, that is that reflect with different level of accuracy the dynamics of the real world. Running simulations of the different fidelities also have a different cost: hight fidelity simulations are more expensive the cheaper ones. If we have access to these simulators we can combine high and low fidelity simulations under the same model.</p>
<p>So let's assume that we have two simulators of the mountain car dynamics, one of high fidelity (the one we have used) and another one of low fidelity. The traditional approach to this form of multi-fidelity emulation is to assume that</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mappingFunction_i\left(\inputVector\right) = \rho\mappingFunction_{i-1}\left(\inputVector\right) + \delta_i\left(\inputVector \right)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(\mappingFunction_{i-1}\left(\inputVector\right)\)</span> is a low fidelity simulation of the problem of interest and <span class="math inline">\(\mappingFunction_i\left(\inputVector\right)\)</span> is a higher fidelity simulation. The function <span class="math inline">\(\delta_i\left(\inputVector \right)\)</span> represents the difference between the lower and higher fidelity simulation, which is considered additive. The additive form of this covariance means that if <span class="math inline">\(\mappingFunction_{0}\left(\inputVector\right)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\left\{\delta_i\left(\inputVector \right)\right\}_{i=1}^m\)</span> are all Gaussian processes, then the process over all fidelities of simuation will be a joint Gaussian process.</p>
<p>But with Deep Gaussian processes we can consider the form</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\mappingFunction_i\left(\inputVector\right) = \mappingFunctionTwo_{i}\left(\mappingFunction_{i-1}\left(\inputVector\right)\right) + \delta_i\left(\inputVector \right),\]</span></p>
<p>where the low fidelity representation is non linearly transformed by <span class="math inline">\(\mappingFunctionTwo(\cdot)\)</span> before use in the process. This is the approach taken in <span class="citation">Perdikaris et al. (2017)</span>. But once we accept that these models can be composed, a highly flexible framework can emerge. A key point is that the data enters the model at different levels, and represents different aspects. For example these correspond to the two fidelities of the mountain car simulator.</p>
<p>We start by sampling both of them at 250 random input locations.</p>
