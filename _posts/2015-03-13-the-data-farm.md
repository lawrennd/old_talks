title: The Data Farm
abstract: |-
  Like Hansel and Gretel’s breadcrumbs into the forest we leave a data trail of data-crumbs wherever we go: social networks, mobile 
  phones, hospital visits, credit cards and loyalty cards. Our every move is being watched! The data-crumbs are seeds of information but 
  what results from them... is it a jungle with dangers lurking or a productive farmyard? And if our data is being farmed, where does all 
  the produce go?
