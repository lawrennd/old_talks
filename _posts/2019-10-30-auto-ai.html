title: "AutoAI"
venue: "10 Minute Talk, Wednesday Meeting, Department of Computer Science and Technology, University of Cambridge"
abstract: "Deployed artificial intelligence solutions consist of interacting components often trained as the result of <em>supervised machine learning</em>. Automatic training of these sub-components is known as AutoML. But the real world challenges of deployment consist of the monitoring of system performance in the real world, in terms of accuracy but also for fairness and bias. To make such systems easily maintainable there is a need for automation of the process of monitoring and redeploying models as well as checking the quality of the overall system decomposition. In contrast to AutoML, we call this system-wide approach “Auto AI”. This is the subject of my Turing Fellowship"

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions are based on machine learning algorithms (ML), but each ML solution is only capable of solving a restricted task, e.g. a supervised learning problem. Consequently, any AI that we deploy today takes the form of an ML System with interacting components. As these ML systems become larger and more complex, challenges in interpretation, explanation, accuracy and fairness arise. This project addresses these issues. The challenges include <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:threeds19">(Lawrence 2019)</span>: the <em>decomposition</em> of the system, the <em>data</em> availability, and the performance of the system in <em>deployment</em>. Collectively we refer to these challenges as the “Three Ds of ML Systems Design”.</p>

<p>From December 2019 I begin a <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/welcoming-world-class-turing-ai-fellows-institute">Senior AI Fellowship at the Turing Institute</a> funded by the Office for AI to investigate the consequences of deploying complex AI systems.</p>
<p>The notion relates from the “Promise of AI”: it promises to be the first generation of automation technology that will adapt to us, rather than us adapting to it. The premise of the project is that this promise will remain unfulfilled with current approaches to systems design and deployment.</p>
<h2 id="project-description">Project Description</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>It used to be true that computers only did what we programmed them to do, but today AI systems are learning from our data. This introduces new problems in how these systems respond to their environment.</p>
<p>We need to better monitor how data is influencing decision making and take corrective action as required.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="aim">Aim</h2>
<p>Our aim is to scale our ability to deploy safe and reliable AI solutions. Our technical approach is to do this through <em>data-oriented software engineering</em> practices and <em>deep system emulation</em>. We will do this through a significant extension of the notion of Automated ML (AutoML) to Automated AI (AutoAI), this relies on a shift from Bayesian Optimisation to <em>Bayesian System Optimisation</em>. The project will develop a toolkit for automating the deployment, maintenance and monitoring of artificial intelligence systems.</p>

<p>The promise of the fourth industrial revolution is that this wave of automation is the first wave of automation where the machines adapt to serve us rather than us adapting to serve the machine.</p>
<p>That promise will remain unfulfilled with our current approach to systems design.</p>
<h2 id="computer-science-paradigm-shift">Computer Science Paradigm Shift</h2>
<p>The next wave of machine learning is a paradigm shift in the way we think about computer science.</p>
<p>Classical computer science assumes that ‘data’ and ‘code’ are separate, and this is the foundation of secure computer systems. In machine learning, ‘data’ is ‘software’, so the decision making is directly influenced by the data. We are short-circuiting a fundamental assumption of computer science, we are breeching the code/data separation.</p>
<p>This means we need to revisit many of our assumptions and tooling around the machine learning process. In particular, we need new approaches to systems design, new approaches to programming languages that highlight the importance of data, and new approaches to systems security.</p>
<p>This gives vulnerabilities that we are exposing to the natural environment. Many security problems that we face today are the result of bugs that mean that code and data are not separate in thee systems we deploy, imagine what will happen when we deploy systems that purposefully short-circuit this protection into uncontrolled environments.</p>
<h2 id="technical-consequence-edit">Technical Consequence <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/snippets/edit/main/_ai/includes/ml-system-decomposability.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/snippets/edit/main/_ai/includes/ml-system-decomposability.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h2>
<p>Classical systems design assumes that the system is decomposable. That we can decompose the complex decision making process into distinct and independently designable parts. The composition of these parts gives us our final system.</p>
<p>Nicolas Negroponte, the original founder of MIT’s media lab used to write a column called ‘bits and atoms’. This referred to the ability of information to effect movement of goods in the physical world. It is this interaction where machine learning technologies have the possibility to bring most benefit.</p>
<h2 id="data-oriented-architectures">Data Oriented Architectures</h2>
<p>In a streaming architecture we shift from management of services, to management of data streams. Instead of worrying about availability of the services we shift to worrying about the quality of the data those services are producing.</p>
<h2 id="streaming-system">Streaming System</h2>
<p>Characteristics of a streaming system include a move from <em>pull</em> updates to <em>push</em> updates, i.e. the computation is driven by a change in the input data rather than the service calling for input data when it decides to run a computation. Streaming systems operate on ‘rows’ of the data rather than ‘columns’. This is because the full column isn’t normally available as it changes over time. As an important design principle, the services themselves are stateless, they take their state from the streaming ecosystem. This ensures the inputs and outputs of given computations are easy to declare. As a result, persistence of the data is also handled by the streaming ecosystem and decisions around data retention or recomputation can be taken at the systems level rather than the component level.</p>
<h2 id="hypothetical-streams">Hypothetical Streams</h2>
<p>We’ll call the future price a hypothetical stream.</p>
<p>A hypothetical stream is a desired stream of information which cannot be directly accessed. The lack of direct access may be because the events happen in the future, or there may be some latency between the event and the availability of the data.</p>
<p>Any hypothetical stream will only be provided as a prediction, ideally with an error bar.</p>
<p>The nature of the hypothetical Anne needs is dependent on her decision-making process. In Anne’s case it will depend over what period she is expecting her returns. In MDOP Anne specifies a hypothetical that is derived from the pricing stream.</p>
<p>It is not the price stream directly, but Anne looks for <em>future</em> predictions from the price stream, perhaps for price in <span class="math inline"><em>T</em></span> days’ time.</p>
<p>At this stage, this stream is merely typed as a hypothetical.</p>
<p>There are constraints on the hypothetical, they include: the <em>input</em> information, the upper limit of latency between input and prediction, and the decision Anne needs to make (how far ahead, what her upside, downside risks are). These three constraints mean that we can only recover an approximation to the hypothetical.</p>
<h2 id="hypothetical-advantage">Hypothetical Advantage</h2>
<p>What is the advantage to defining things in this way? By defining, clearly, the two streams as real and hypothetical variants of each other, we now enable automation of the deployment and any redeployment process. The hypothetical can be <em>instantiated</em> against the real, and design criteria can be constantly evaluated triggering retraining when necessary.</p>
<p>Let’s consider a ride sharing app, for example the SafeBoda system.</p>
<p>Anne is on her way home now; she wishes to hail a car using a ride sharing app.</p>
<p>The app is designed in the following way. On opening her app Anne is notified about drivers in the nearby neighborhood. She is given an estimate of the time a ride may take to come.</p>
<p>Given this information about driver availability, Anne may feel encouraged to enter a destination. Given this destination, a price estimate can be given. This price is conditioned on other riders that may wish to go in the same direction, but the price estimate needs to be made before the user agrees to the ride.</p>
<p>Business customer service constraints dictate that this price may not change after Anne’s order is confirmed.</p>
<p>In this simple system, several decisions are being made, each of them on the basis of a hypothetical.</p>
<p>When Anne calls for a ride, she is provided with an estimate based on the expected time a ride can be with her. But this estimate is made without knowing where Anne wants to go. There are constraints on drivers imposed by regional boundaries, reaching the end of their shift, or their current passengers mean that this estimate can only be a best guess.</p>
<p>This best guess may well be driven by previous data.</p>

<p>The modern approach to software systems design is known as a <em>service-oriented architectures</em> (SOA). The idea is that software engineers are responsible for the availability and reliability of the API that accesses the service they own. Quality of service is maintained by rigorous standards around <em>testing</em> of software systems.</p>

<p>Figure: Data oriented architecture. Now the joins and the updates are exposed within the streaming ecosystem. We can programatically determine the factor graph which gives the thread through the model.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In data driven decision-making systems, the quality of decision-making is determined by the quality of the data. We need to extend the notion of <em>service</em>-oriented architecture to <em>data</em>-oriented architecture (DOA).</p>
<p>The focus in SOA is eliminating <em>hard</em> failures. Hard failures can occur due to bugs or systems overload. This notion needs to be extended in ML systems to capture <em>soft failures</em> associated with declining data quality, incorrect modeling assumptions and inappropriate re-deployments of models. We need to focus on data quality assessments. In data-oriented architectures engineering teams are responsible for the <em>quality</em> of their output data streams in addition to the <em>availability</em> of the service they support <span class="citation" data-cites="Lawrence:drl17">(Lawrence 2017)</span>. Quality here is not just accuracy, but fairness and explainability. This important cultural change would be capable of addressing both the challenge of <em>technical debt</em> <span class="citation" data-cites="Sculley:debt15">(Sculley et al. 2015)</span> and the social responsibility of ML systems.</p>
<p>Software development proceeds with a <em>test-oriented</em> culture. One where tests are written before software, and software is not incorporated in the wider system until all tests pass. We must apply the same standards of care to our ML systems, although for ML we need statistical tests for quality, fairness and consistency within the environment. Fortunately, the main burden of this testing need not fall to the engineers themselves: through leveraging <em>classical statistics</em> and <em>emulation</em> we will automate the creation and redeployment of these tests across the software ecosystem, we call this <em>ML hypervision</em> (WP5 ).</p>
<p>Modern AI can be based on ML models with many millions of parameters, trained on very large data sets. In ML, strong emphasis is placed on <em>predictive accuracy</em> whereas sister-fields such as statistics have a strong emphasis on <em>interpretability</em>. ML models are said to be ‘black boxes’ which make decisions that are not explainable.<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Figure: Data-oriented programing. There is a requirement for an estimate of the driver allocation to give a rough cost estimate before the user has confirmed the ride. In data-oriented programming, this is achieved through declaring a hypothetical stream which approximates the true driver allocation, but with restricted input information and constraints on the computational latency.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>For the ride sharing system, we start to see a common issue with a more complex algorithmic decision-making system. Several decisions are being made multilple times. Let’s look at the decisions we need along with some design criteria.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Driver Availability: Estimate time to arrival for Anne’s ride using Anne’s location and local available car locations. Latency 50 milliseconds</li>
<li>Cost Estimate: Estimate cost for journey using Anne’s destination, location and local available car current destinations and availability. Latency 50 milliseconds</li>
<li>Driver Allocation: Allocate car to minimize transport cost to destination. Latency 2 seconds.</li>
</ol>
<p>So we need:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>a hypothetical to estimate availability. It is constrained by lacking destination information and a low latency requirement.</li>
<li>a hypothetical to estimate cost. It is constrained by low latency requirement and</li>
</ol>
<p>Simultaneously, drivers in this data ecosystem have an app which notifies them about new jobs and recommends them where to go.</p>
<p>Further advantages. Strategies for data retention (when to snapshot) can be set globally.</p>
<p>A few decisions need to be made in this system. First of all, when the user opens the app, the estimate of the time to the nearest ride may need to be computed quickly, to avoid latency in the service.</p>
<p>This may require a quick estimate of the ride availability.</p>

<p>With all the second guessing within a complex automated decision-making system, there are potential problems with information dynamics, the ‘closed loop’ problem, where the sub-systems are being approximated (second guessing) and predictions downstream are being affected.</p>
<p>This leads to the need for a closed loop analysis, for example, see the <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/">“Closed Loop Data Science”</a> project led by Rod Murray-Smith at Glasgow.</p>

<p>Supervised machine learning models are data-driven statistical functional estimators. Each ML model is trained to perform a task. Machine learning systems are created when these models are integrated as interacting components in a more complex system that carries out a larger scale task, e.g. an autonomous drone delivery system.</p>
<p>Artificial Intelligence can also be seen as <em>algorithmic decision-making</em>. ML systems are <em>data driven</em> algorithmic decision-makers. Designing decision-making engines requires us to firstly decompose the system into its component parts. The decompositions are driven by (1) system performance requirements (2) the suite of ML algorithms at our disposal (3) the data availability. Performance requirements could be computational speed, accuracy, interpretability, and ‘fairness’. The current generation of ML Systems is often based around <em>supervised learning</em> and human annotated data. But in the future, we may expect more use of <em>reinforcement learning</em> and automated knowledge discovery using <em>unsupervised learning</em>.</p>
<p>The classical systems approach assumes decomposability of components. In ML, upstream components (e.g. a pedestrian detector in an autonomous vehicle) make decisions that require revisiting once a fuller picture is realized at a downstream stage (e.g. vehicle path planning). The relative weaknesses and strengths of the different component parts need to be assessed when resolving conflicts.</p>
<p>In long-term planning, e.g. logistics and supply chain, a plan may be computed multiple times under different constraints as data evolves. In logistics, an initial plan for delivery may be computed when an item is viewed on a webpage. Webpage waiting-time constraints dominate the solution we choose. However, when an order is placed the time constraint may be relaxed and an accuracy constraint or a cost constraint may now dominate.</p>
<p>Such sub-systems will make inconsistent decisions, but we should monitor and control the extent of the inconsistency.</p>
<p>One solution to aid with both the lack of decomposability of the components and the inconsistency between components is <em>end-to-end</em> learning of the system. End-to-end learning is when we use ML techniques to fit parameters across the entire decision pipeline. We exploit gradient descent and automated differentiation software to achieve this. However, components in the system may themselves be running a <em>simulation</em> (e.g. a transport delivery-time simulation) or <em>optimization</em> (e.g. a linear program) as a subroutine. This limits the universality of automatic differentiation. Another alternative is to replace the entire system with a single ML model, such as in Deep Reinforcement Learning. However, this can severely limit the interpretability of the resulting system.</p>
<p>We envisage AutoAI as allowing us to take advantage of end-to-end learning without sacrificing the interpretability of the underlying system. Instead of optimizing each component individually, we introduce <em>Bayesian system optimization</em> (BSO). We will make use of the end-to-end learning signals and attribute them to the system sub-components through the construction of an interconnected network of <em>surrogate models</em>, known as emulators, each of which is associated with an individual component from the underlying ML-system. Instead of optimizing each component individually (e.g. by classical Bayesian optimization) in BSO we account for upstream and downstream interactions in the optimization, leveraging our end-to-end knowledge without damaging the interpretability of the underlying system.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion-edit">Conclusion <span class="editsection-bracket" style="">[</span><span class="editsection" style=""><a href="https://github.com/lawrennd/snippets/edit/main/_ai/includes/auto-ai-conclusions.md" target="_blank" onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'Edit Page', 'Edit', 'https://github.com/lawrennd/snippets/edit/main/_ai/includes/auto-ai-conclusions.md', 13);">edit</a></span><span class="editsection-bracket" style="">]</span></h2>
<p>Data oriented programming offers a set of development methodologies which ensure that the system designer considers what decisions are required, how they will be made, and critically, declares this within the system architecture.</p>
<p>This allows for monitoring of <em>data quality</em>, <em>fairness</em>, <em>model accuracy</em> and opens the door to a more sophisticated form of auto ML where full redployments of models are considered while analyzing the information dynamics of a complex automated decision-making system.</p>
<p>To deploy these ideas we need expertise from the programming language community for specifying and compiling the interaction of data flows to infer the roles of the services/models. The systems community for maintaining the ecosystem of data flows (likely streaming systems). The security community for managing permissions in these systems.</p>
<p>There are implications for the hardware and networking communities, because if we can standardise around the specification of a modern data-oriented programming we should expect to be able to compile it to different system architectures at the hardware level (e.g. edge vs cloud computing, TPUs vs GPUs vs CPUs for handign loads etc).</p>
