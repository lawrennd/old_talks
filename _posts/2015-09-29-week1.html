<p>Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook.</p>
<p>The notebook provides us with a way of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions and explore the nature of a data set. It is <em>different</em> to normal coding, but it is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers. The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you think about normal programming, or ‘classical software engineering’. Classical software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The design evolves through a process known as <em>exploratory data analysis</em>. You will learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.</p>
<p>A particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests).</p>
<p>Data analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn’t doing it.</p>
<p>Naturally, debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you don’t understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines, but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three lines is far greater than in standard code.</p>

<h2 id="linear-algebra-probability-and-differential-calculus">Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus</h2>
<p>We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of variation, e.g. differentiation and integration. A new concept for the course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional distributions.</p>

<p>In this course we will be using Python for our programming language. A prerequisite of attending this course is that you have learnt at least one programming language in the past. It is not our objective to teach you python. At Level 4 and Masters we expect our students to be able pick up a language as they go. If you have not experienced python before it may be worth your while spending some time understanding the language. There are resources available for you to do this <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/">here</a> that are based on the standard console. An introduction to the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook) is available <a href="http://ipython.org/ipython-%20doc/2/notebook/index.html">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="choice-of-environment">Choice of Environment</h1>
<p>We are working in the Jupyter notebook (formerly known as the IPython notebook). It provides an environment for interacting with data in a natural way which is reproducible. We will be learning how to make use of the notebook throughout the course. The notebook allows us to combine code with descriptions, interactive visualizations, plots etc. In fact it allows us to do many of the things we need for data science. Notebooks can also be easily shared through the internet for ease of communication of ideas. The box this text is written in is a <em>markdown</em> box. Below we have a <em>code</em> box.</p>

<p>Have a play with the code in the above box. Think about the following questions: what is the difference between <code>CTRL-enter</code> and <code>SHIFT-enter</code> in running the code? What does the command <code>shuffle</code> do? Can you find out by typing <code>shuffle?</code> in a code box? Once you’ve had a play with the code we can load in some data using the <code>pandas</code> library for data analysis.</p>

<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a combination of</p>
<p><br /><span class="math display">$$\text{data} + \text{model} \xrightarrow{\text{compute}} \text{prediction}$$</span><br /></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> a function which is used to make the predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness, spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> a function which defines the cost of misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world’s generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and the objectie function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the acdemic field of machine learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring different types of models and data together.</p>

<p>The challenge with a linear model is that it has two unknowns, <span class="math inline"><em>m</em></span>, and <span class="math inline"><em>c</em></span>. Observing data allows us to write down a system of simultaneous linear equations. So, for example if we observe two data points, the first with the input value, <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar_1 = 1$</span> and the output value, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar_1 =3$</span> and a second data point, <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar = 3$</span>, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar=1$</span>, then we can write two simultaneous linear equations of the form.</p>
<p>point 1: <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar = 1$</span>, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar=3$</span> <br /><span class="math display">3 = <em>m</em> + <em>c</em></span><br /> point 2: <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar = 3$</span>, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar=1$</span> <br /><span class="math display">1 = 3<em>m</em> + <em>c</em></span><br /></p>
<p>The solution to these two simultaneous equations can be represented graphically as</p>

<p>This is known as an <em>overdetermined</em> system because there are more data than we need to determine our parameters. The problem arises because the model is a simplification of the real world, and the data we observe is therefore inconsistent with our model.</p>

<p>Famously, Laplace considered the idea of a deterministic Universe, one in which the model is <em>known</em>, or as the below translation refers to it, “an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated”. He speculates on an “intelligence” that can submit this vast data to analysis and propsoses that such an entity would be able to predict the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it—an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis—it would embrace in the same formulate the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present in its eyes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This notion is known as <em>Laplace’s demon</em> or <em>Laplace’s superman</em>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, most analyses of his ideas stop at that point, whereas his real point is that such a notion is unreachable. Not so much <em>superman</em> as <em>strawman</em>. Just three pages later in the “Philosophical Essay on Probabilities” <span class="citation" data-cites="Laplace:essai14">(Laplace 1814)</span>, Laplace goes on to observe:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The curve described by a simple molecule of air or vapor is regulated in a manner just as certain as the planetary orbits; the only difference between them is that which comes from our ignorance.</p>
<p>Probability is relative, in part to this ignorance, in part to our knowledge.</p>

<p>In other words, we can never make use of the idealistic deterministc Universe due to our ignorance about the world, Laplace’s suggestion, and focus in this essay is that we turn to probability to deal with this uncertainty. This is also our inspiration for using probability in machine learning.</p>
<p>The “forces by which nature is animated” is our <em>model</em>, the “situation of beings that compose it” is our <em>data</em> and the “intelligence sufficiently vast enough to submit these data to analysis” is our compute. The fly in the ointment is our <em>ignorance</em> about these aspects. And <em>probability</em> is the tool we use to incorporate this ignorance leading to uncertainty or <em>doubt</em> in our predictions.</p>
<p>Laplace’s concept was that the reason that the data doesn’t match up to the model is because of unconsidered factors, and that these might be well represented through probability densities. He tackles the challenge of the unknown factors by adding a variable, <span class="math inline">$\noiseScalar$</span>, that represents the unknown. In modern parlance we would call this a <em>latent</em> variable. But in the context Laplace uses it, the variable is so common that it has other names such as a “slack” variable or the <em>noise</em> in the system.</p>
<p>point 1: <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar = 1$</span>, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar=3$</span> <br /><span class="math display">$$
3 = m + c + \noiseScalar_1
$$</span><br /> point 2: <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar = 3$</span>, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar=1$</span> <br /><span class="math display">$$
1 = 3m + c + \noiseScalar_2
$$</span><br /> point 3: <span class="math inline">$\inputScalar = 2$</span>, <span class="math inline">$\dataScalar=2.5$</span> <br /><span class="math display">$$
2.5 = 2m + c + \noiseScalar_3
$$</span><br /></p>
<p>Laplace’s trick has converted the <em>overdetermined</em> system into an <em>underdetermined</em> system. He has now added three variables, <span class="math inline">$\{\noiseScalar_i\}_{i=1}^3$</span>, which represent the unknown corruptions of the real world. Laplace’s idea is that we should represent that unknown corruption with a <em>probability distribution</em>.</p>

<p>However, it was left to an admirer of Gauss to develop a practical probability density for that purpose. It was Carl Friederich Gauss who suggested that the <em>Gaussian</em> density (which at the time was unnamed!) should be used to represent this error.</p>
<p>The result is a <em>noisy</em> function, a function which has a deterministic part, and a stochastic part. This type of function is sometimes known as a probabilistic or stochastic process, to distinguish it from a deterministic process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Nigeria MDG (Millennium Development Goals) Information System – NMIS health facility data is collected by the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals (OSSAP-MDGs) in partner with the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. A rigorous, geo-referenced baseline facility inventory across Nigeria is created spanning from 2009 to 2011 with an additional survey effort to increase coverage in 2014, to build Nigeria’s first nation-wide inventory of health facility. The database includes 34,139 health facilities info in Nigeria.</p>
<p>The goal of this database is to make the data collected available to planners, government officials, and the public, to be used to make strategic decisions for planning relevant interventions.</p>

<p>The NMIS facility data is stored in an object known as a ‘data frame’. Data frames come from the statistical family of programming languages based on <code>S</code>, the most widely used of which is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)"><code>R</code></a>. The data frame gives us a convenient object for manipulating data. The describe method summarizes which columns there are in the data frame and gives us counts, means, standard deviations and percentiles for the values in those columns. To access a column directly we can write</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb9"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb9-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="bu">print</span>(data[<span class="st">&#39;num_doctors_fulltime&#39;</span>])</a>

<p>This shows the number of doctors per facility, number of nurses and number of community health workers (CHEWS). We can plot the number of doctors against the number of nurses as follows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb10"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><a class="sourceLine" id="cb10-1" data-line-number="1"><span class="co"># this ensures the plot appears in the web browser</span></a>

<p>You may be curious what the arguments we give to <code>plt.plot</code> are for, now is the perfect time to look at the documentation</p>

<p>We immediately note that some facilities have a lot of nurses, which prevent’s us seeing the detail of the main number of facilities. First lets identify the facilities with the most nurses.</p>

<p>Here we are using the command <code>data['num_nurses_fulltime']&gt;100</code> to index the facilities in the pandas data frame which have over 100 nurses. To sort them in order we can also use the <code>sort</code> command. The result of this command on its own is a data <code>Series</code> of <code>True</code> and <code>False</code> values. However, when it is passed to the <code>data</code> data frame it returns a new data frame which contains only those values for which the data series is <code>True</code>. We can also sort the result. To sort the result by the values in the <code>num_nurses_fulltime</code> column in <em>descending</em> order we use the following command.</p>

<p>We now see that the ‘University of Calabar Teaching Hospital’ is a large outlier with 513 nurses. We can try and determine how much of an outlier by histograming the data.</p>

<p>Note a few things. We are interacting with our data. In particular, we are replotting the data according to what we have learned so far. We are using the progamming language as a <em>scripting</em> language to give the computer one command or another, and then the next command we enter is dependent on the result of the previous. This is a very different paradigm to classical software engineering. In classical software engineering we normally write many lines of code (entire object classes or functions) before compiling the code and running it. Our approach is more similar to the approach we take whilst debugging. Historically, researchers interacted with data using a <em>console</em>. A command line window which allowed command entry. The notebook format we are using is slightly different. Each of the code entry boxes acts like a separate console window. We can move up and down the notebook and run each part in a different order. The <em>state</em> of the program is always as we left it after running the previous part.</p>

<p>We are now going to do some simple review of probabilities and use this review to explore some aspects of our data.</p>
<p>A probability distribution expresses uncertainty about the outcome of an event. We often encode this uncertainty in a variable. So if we are considering the outcome of an event, <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em></span>, to be a coin toss, then we might consider <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em> = 1</span> to be heads and <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em> = 0</span> to be tails. We represent the probability of a given outcome with the notation: <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = 1) = 0.5</span><br /> The first rule of probability is that the probability must normalize. The sum of the probability of all events must equal 1. So if the probability of heads (<span class="math inline"><em>Y</em> = 1</span>) is 0.5, then the probability of tails (the only other possible outcome) is given by <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = 0) = 1 − <em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = 1) = 0.5</span><br /></p>
<p>Probabilities are often defined as the limit of the ratio between the number of positive outcomes (e.g. <em>heads</em>) given the number of trials. If the number of positive outcomes for event <span class="math inline"><em>y</em></span> is denoted by <span class="math inline"><em>n</em></span> and the number of trials is denoted by <span class="math inline"><em>N</em></span> then this gives the ratio <br /><span class="math display">$$
P(Y=y) = \lim_{N\rightarrow
\infty}\frac{n_y}{N}.
$$</span><br /> In practice we never get to observe an event infinite times, so rather than considering this we often use the following estimate <br /><span class="math display">$$
P(Y=y) \approx \frac{n_y}{N}.
$$</span><br /></p>

<h1 id="conditioning">Conditioning</h1>
<p>When predicting whether a coin turns up head or tails, we might think that this event is <em>independent</em> of the year or time of day. If we include an observation such as time, then in a probability this is known as <em>condtioning</em>. We use this notation, <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = <em>y</em>|<em>X</em> = <em>x</em>)</span>, to condition the outcome on a second variable (in this case the number of doctors). Or, often, for a shorthand we use <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>|<em>x</em>)</span> to represent this distribution (the <span class="math inline"><em>Y</em>=</span> and <span class="math inline"><em>X</em>=</span> being implicit). If two variables are independent then we find that <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>|<em>x</em>) = <em>p</em>(<em>y</em>).</span><br /> However, we might believe that the number of nurses is dependent on the number of doctors. For this we can try estimating <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> &gt; 2|<em>X</em> &gt; 1)</span> and compare the result, for example to <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> &gt; 2|<em>X</em> ≤ 1)</span> using our empirical estimate of the probability.</p>

<h2 id="notational-details">Notational Details</h2>
<p>Typically we should write out <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>X</em>=<em>x</em>,<em>Y</em>=<em>y</em>)</span>, but in practice we often shorten this to <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>)</span>. This looks very much like we might write a multivariate function, <em>e.g.</em> <br /><span class="math display">$$
  f\left(x,y\right)=\frac{x}{y},
  $$</span><br /> but for a multivariate function <br /><span class="math display"><em>f</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) ≠ <em>f</em>(<em>y</em>,<em>x</em>).</span><br /> However, <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>y</em>,<em>x</em>)</span><br /> because <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>X</em>=<em>x</em>,<em>Y</em>=<em>y</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>Y</em>=<em>y</em>,<em>X</em>=<em>x</em>).</span><br /> Sometimes I think of this as akin to the way in Python we can write ‘keyword arguments’ in functions. If we use keyword arguments, the ordering of arguments doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>We’ve now introduced conditioning and independence to the notion of probability and computed some conditional probabilities on a practical example The scatter plot of deaths vs year that we created above can be seen as a <em>joint</em> probability distribution. We represent a joint probability using the notation <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = <em>y</em>, <em>X</em> = <em>x</em>)</span> or <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>, <em>x</em>)</span> for short. Computing a joint probability is equivalent to answering the simultaneous questions, what’s the probability that the number of nurses was over 2 and the number of doctors was 1? Or any other question that may occur to us. Again we can easily use pandas to ask such questions.</p>

The number can never be bigger than the conditional probabililty because it is computed using the <em>product rule</em>. <br /><span class="math display"><em>p</em>(<em>Y</em> = <em>y</em>, <em>X</em> = <em>x</em>) = <em>p</em>(<em>Y</em> = <em>y</em>|<em>X</em> = <em>x</em>)<em>p</em>(<em>X</em> = <em>x</em>)</span><br /> and <br /><span class="math display"><em>p</em>(<em>X</em> = <em>x</em>)</span><br /> is a probability distribution, which is equal or less than 1, ensuring the joint distribution is typically smaller than the conditional distribution.</p>
<p>The product rule is a <em>fundamental</em> rule of probability, and you must remember it! It gives the relationship between the two questions: 1) What’s the probability that a facility has over two nurses <em>and</em> one doctor? and 2) What’s the probability that a facility has over two nurses <em>given that</em> it has one doctor?</p>
<p>In our shorter notation we can write the product rule as <br /><span class="math display"><em>p</em>(<em>y</em>, <em>x</em>) = <em>p</em>(<em>y</em>|<em>x</em>)<em>p</em>(<em>x</em>)</span><br /> We can see the relation working in practice for our data above by computing the different values for <span class="math inline"><em>x</em> = 1</span>.</p>

<h2 id="the-sum-rule">The Sum Rule</h2>
<p>The other <em>fundamental rule</em> of probability is the <em>sum rule</em> this tells us how to get a <em>marginal</em> distribution from the joint distribution. Simply put it says that we need to sum across the value we’d like to remove. <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = <em>y</em>) = ∑<sub><em>x</em></sub><em>P</em>(<em>Y</em> = <em>y</em>, <em>X</em> = <em>x</em>)</span><br /> Or in our shortened notation <br /><span class="math display"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>) = ∑<sub><em>x</em></sub><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>, <em>x</em>)</span><br /></p>

<h2 id="bayes-rule">Bayes’ Rule</h2>
<p>Bayes rule is a very simple rule, it’s hardly worth the name of a rule at all. It follows directly from the product rule of probability. Because <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>, <em>x</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>y</em>|<em>x</em>)<em>P</em>(<em>x</em>)</span> and by symmetry <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>, <em>x</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) = <em>P</em>(<em>x</em>|<em>y</em>)<em>P</em>(<em>y</em>)</span> then by equating these two equations and dividing through by <span class="math inline"><em>P</em>(<em>y</em>)</span> we have <br /><span class="math display">$$
P(x|y) =
\frac{P(y|x)P(x)}{P(y)}
$$</span><br /> which is known as Bayes’ rule (or Bayes’s rule, it depends how you choose to pronounce it). It’s not difficult to derive, and its importance is more to do with the semantic operation that it enables. Each of these probability distributions represents the answer to a question we have about the world. Bayes rule (via the product rule) tells us how to <em>invert</em> the probability.</p>

<p>What use is all this probability in data science? Let’s think about how we might use the probabilities to do some decision making. Let’s look at the information data.</p>

<!--## More Fun on the Python Data Farm 

If you want to explore more of the things
you can do with movies and python you might be interested in the `imdbpy` python
library.

You can try installing it using `pip` as follows.

```{.python}
%pip install IMDbPY
```

If this doesn't work on your machine, try following instructions on
(http://imdbpy.sourceforge.net/)

Once you've installed `imdbpy` you can test it
works with the following script, which should list movies with the word 'python'
in their title. To run the code in the following box, simply click the box and
press `SHIFT-enter` or `CTRL-enter`. Then you can try running the code below.

```{.python}
from imdb import IMDb
ia = IMDb()

for movie in ia.search_movie('python'):
    print(movie)
```-->
