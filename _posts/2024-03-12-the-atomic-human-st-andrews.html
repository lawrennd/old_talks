title: "The Atomic Human"
venue: "St Andrews’ Distinguished Lecture Series"
abstract: "<p>A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we’re
having about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our
identity?</p>
<p>Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
intelligence. We believe it’s what differentiates us. Fears of AI not
only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied
threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the
centre of the world.</p>
<p>Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components: eventually
we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek for uncuttable is
‘atom’). In the same way, by slicing away at the facets of human
intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI uncovers what is left:
an indivisible core that is the essence of humanity.</p>
<p>By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The
Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations
of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just by the experts,
but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or we become a tool of
AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose the future we want.</p>
<p>This talk is based on Neil’s forthcoming book to be published with
Allen Lane in June 2024. Machine learning solutions, in particular those
based on deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the current
revolution in “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press
headlines and is having a significant influence on the wider tech
agenda.</p>
<p>In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with machine
learning solutions, and what challenges we face both in the near and far
future. These include practical application of existing algorithms in
the face of the need to explain decision making, mechanisms for
improving the quality and availability of data, dealing with large
unstructured datasets.</p>"

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"

</div>
<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially develoepd for people as a recordd of who owed what
to whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>We have already seen the effects of this changed dynamic in biology
and computational biology. Improved sensorics have led to the new
domains of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and ‘rich phenomics’ as well as
considerably augmenting our capabilities in genomics.</p>
<p>Biologists have had to become data-savvy, they require a rich
understanding of the available data resources and need to assimilate
existing data sets in their hypothesis generation as well as their
experimental design. Modern biology has become a far more quantitative
science, but the quantitativeness has required new methods developed in
the domains of <em>computational biology</em> and
<em>bioinformatics</em>.</p>
<p>There is also great promise for personalized health, but in health
the wide data-sharing that has underpinned success in the computational
biology community is much harder to carry out.</p>
<p>We can expect to see these phenomena reflected in wider society.
Particularly as we make use of more automated decision making based only
on data. This is leading to a requirement to better understand our own
subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface allows
domain experts to assimilate data driven conclusions in a well
calibrated manner. This is particularly important where medical
treatments are being prescribed. It also offers potential for different
kinds of medical intervention. More subtle interventions are possible
when the digital environment is able to respond to users in an bespoke
manner. This has particular implications for treatment of mental health
conditions.</p>
<p>The main phenomenon we see across the board is the shift in dynamic
from the direct pathway between human and data, as traditionally
mediated by classical statistics, to a new flow of information via the
computer. This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging
domain of <em>data science</em>, where the interactions between human
and data are mediated by the machine.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics</p>
<p>Arthur Balfour 1848-1930</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Arthur Balfour was quoting the lawyer James Munro<a href="#fn2"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>
when he said that there three types of lies: lies, damned lies and
statistics in 1892. This is 20 years before the first academic
department of applied statistics was founded at UCL. If Balfour were
alive today, it is likely that he’d rephrase his quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and <em>big
data</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Because the challenges of understanding and interpreting big
data today are similar to those that Balfour (who was a Conservative
politician and statesman and would later become Prime Minister) faced in
governing an empire through statistics in the latter part of the 19th
century.</p>
<p>The quote lies, damned lies and statistics was also credited to
Benjamin Disraeli by Mark Twain in Twain’s autobiography.<a href="#fn3"
class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a> It
characterizes the idea that statistic can be made to prove anything. But
Disraeli died in 1881 and Mark Twain died in 1910. The important
breakthrough in overcoming our tendency to over-interpet data came with
the formalization of the field through the development of
<em>mathematical statistics</em>.</p>
<p>Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver
little, it can mislead and misrepresent. To harness it, it must be
tamed. In Balfour and Disraeli’s time during the second half of the 19th
century, numbers and data were being accumulated, the social sciences
were being developed. There was a large-scale collection of data for the
purposes of government.</p>
<p>The modern ‘big data era’ is on the verge of delivering the same
sense of frustration that Balfour experienced, the early promise of big
data as a panacea is evolving to demands for delivery. For me,
personally, peak-hype coincided with an email I received inviting
collaboration on a project to deploy “<em>Big Data</em> and <em>Internet
of Things</em> in an <em>Industry 4.0</em> environment”. Further
questioning revealed that the actual project was optimization of the
efficiency of a manufacturing production line, a far more tangible and
<em>realizable</em> goal.</p>
<p>The antidote to this verbiage is found in increasing awareness. When
dealing with data the first trap to avoid is the games of buzzword bingo
that we are wont to play. The first goal is to quantify what challenges
can be addressed and what techniques are required. Behind the hype
fundamentals are changing. The phenomenon is about the increasing access
we have to data. The way customers’ information is recorded and
processes are codified and digitized with little overhead. Internet of
things is about the increasing number of cheap sensors that can be
easily interconnected through our modern network structures. But
businesses are about making money, and these phenomena need to be recast
in those terms before their value can be realized.</p>

(1857-1936), <a

(1890-1962) and others considered the question of what conclusions can
truly be drawn from data. Their mathematical studies act as a restraint
on our tendency to over-interpret and see patterns where there are none.
They introduced concepts such as randomized control trials that form a
mainstay of our decision making today, from government, to clinicians to
large scale A/B testing that determines the nature of the web interfaces
we interact with on social media and shopping.</p>

<p>Their movement did the most to put statistics to rights, to eradicate
the ‘damned lies’. It was known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics">‘mathematical
statistics’</a>. Today I believe we should look to the emerging field of
<em>data science</em> to provide the same role. Data science is an
amalgam of statistics, data mining, computer systems, databases,
computation, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Spread across
these fields are the tools we need to realize data’s potential. For many
businesses this might be thought of as the challenge of ‘converting bits
into atoms’. Bits: the data stored on computer, atoms: the physical
manifestation of what we do; the transfer of goods, the delivery of
service. From fungible to tangible. When solving a challenge through
data there are a series of obstacles that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Firstly, data awareness: what data you have and where its stored.
Sometimes this includes changing your conception of what data is and how
it can be obtained. From automated production lines to apps on employee
smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential
data, personal data. For increasing awareness an internal audit can
help. The website <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> hosts
data made available by the UK government. To create this website the
government’s departments went through an audit of what data they each
hold and what data they could make available. Similarly, within private
businesses this type of audit could be useful for understanding their
internal digital landscape: after all the key to any successful campaign
is a good map.</p>
<p>Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?
How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with
unreliable data and <em>unreliable statistics</em>. The
misrepresentations this leads to are worse than the absence of data as
they give a false sense of confidence to decision making. Understanding
how to avoid these pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its
value, one that needs to permeate the organization.</p>
<p>The final challenge is analysis, the accumulation of the necessary
expertise to digest what the data tells us. Data requires
interpretation, and interpretation requires experience. Analysis is
providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made
more acute by the fact that, ideally, analysis should be carried out by
individuals not only skilled in data science but also equipped with the
domain knowledge to understand the implications in a given application,
and to see opportunities for improvements in efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-data-science">‘Mathematical Data Science’</h2>
<p>As a term ‘big data’ promises much and delivers little, to get true
value from data, it needs to be curated and evaluated. The three stages
of awareness, availability and analysis provide a broad framework
through which organizations should be assessing the potential in the
data they hold. Hand waving about big data solutions will not do, it
will only lead to self-deception. The castles we build on our data
landscapes must be based on firm foundations, process and scientific
analysis. If we do things right, those are the foundations that will be
provided by the new field of data science.</p>
<p>Today the statement “There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies
and ‘big data’” may be more apt. We are revisiting many of the mistakes
made in interpreting data from the 19th century. Big data is laid down
by happenstance, rather than actively collected with a particular
question in mind. That means it needs to be treated with care when
conclusions are being drawn. For data science to succeed it needs the
same form of rigor that Pearson and Fisher brought to statistics, a
“mathematical data science” is needed.</p>

<p>For human conversation to work, we require an internal model of who
we are speaking to. We model each other, and combine our sense of who
they are, who they think we are, and what has been said. This is our
approach to dealing with the limited bandwidth connection we have.
Empathy and understanding of intent. Mental dispositional concepts are
used to augment our limited communication bandwidth.</p>

<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

As an exercise in understanding complexity, watch the following video. You will see the basketball being bounced around, and the players moving. Your job is to count the passes of those dressed in white and ignore those of the individuals dressed in black.

In a classic study @Simons-gorillas99 ask subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these subjects don't notice the gorilla moving across the scene.

The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö Bálint,

> It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.
>
> Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)


When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other (potentially vital) contextual information.

This phenomenon is known as selective attention or 'inattentional blindness'.

model to other tanks representing government spending, such as health
and education. The machine was initially designed for teaching support

<p>Donald MacKay was a physicist who worked on naval gun targetting
during the second world war. The challenge with gun targetting for ships
is that both the target and the gun platform are moving. The challenge
was tackled using analogue computers, for example in the US the <a

on radar systems for gun laying, here the velocity and distance of the

<p>Like many challenges we face today, in the second world war, fire
control was handled by a hybrid system of humans and computers. This
means deploying human beings for the tasks that they can manage, and
machines for the tasks that are better performed by a machine. This
leads to a division of labour between the machine and the human that can
still be found in our modern digital ecosystems.</p>

<p>Donald MacKay was at King’s College for his PhD. He was just down the
road from Bill Phillips at LSE who was building the MONIAC. He was part
of the Ratio Club. A group of early career scientists who were
interested in communication and control in animals and humans, or more
specifically they were interested in computers and brains. The were part
of an international movement known as cybernetics.</p>
<p>Donald MacKay wrote of the influence that his own work on radar had
on his interest in the brain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… during the war I had worked on the theory of automated and
electronic computing and on the theory of information, all of which are
highly relevant to such things as automatic pilots and automatic gun
direction. I found myself grappling with problems in the design of
artificial sense organs for naval gun-directors and with the principles
on which electronic circuits could be used to simulate situations in the
external world so as to provide goal-directed guidance for ships,
aircraft, missiles and the like.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Later in the 1940’s, when I was doing my Ph.D. work, there was much
talk of the brain as a computer and of the early digital computers that
were just making the headlines as “electronic brains.” As an analogue
computer man I felt strongly convinced that the brain, whatever it was,
was not a digital computer. I didn’t think it was an analogue computer
either in the conventional sense.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>But this naturally rubbed under my skin the question: well, if it is
not either of these, what kind of system is it? Is there any way of
following through the kind of analysis that is appropriate to their
artificial automata so as to understand better the kind of system the
human brain is? That was the beginning of my slippery slope into brain
research.</p>
<p><em>Behind the Eye</em> pg 40. Edited version of the 1986 Gifford
Lectures given by Donald M. MacKay and edited by Valerie MacKay</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Importantly, MacKay distinguishes between the <em>analogue</em>
computer and the <em>digital</em> computer. As he mentions, his
experience was with analogue machines. An analogue machine is
<em>literally</em> an analogue. The radar systems that Wiener and MacKay
both worked on were made up of electronic components such as resistors,
capacitors, inductors and/or mechanical components such as cams and
gears. Together these components could represent a physical system, such
as an anti-aircraft gun and a plane. The design of the analogue computer
required the engineer to simulate the real world in analogue
electronics, using dualities that exist between e.g. mechanical circuits
(mass, spring, damper) and electronic circuits (inductor, resistor,
capacitor). The analogy between mass and a damper, between spring and a
resistor and between capacitor and a damper works because the underlying
mathematics is approximated with the same linear system: a second order
differential equation. This mathematical analogy allowed the designer to
map from the real world, through mathematics, to a virtual world where
the components reflected the real world through analogy.</p>
<h2 id="human-analogue-machine">Human Analogue Machine</h2>
<p>The machine learning systems we have built today that can reconstruct
human text, or human classification of images, necessarily must have
some aspects to them that are analagous to our understanding. As MacKay
suggests the brain is neither a digital or an analogue computer, and the
same can be said of the modern neural network systems that are being
tagged as “artificial intelligence”.</p>
<p>I believe a better term for them is “human-analogue machines”,
because what we have built is not a system that can make intelligent
decisions from first principles (a rational approach) but one that
observes how humans have made decisions through our data and
reconstructs that process. Machine learning is more empiricist than
rational, but now we n empirical approach that distils our evolved
intelligence.</p>

<p>Figure: Jonathan Zittrain’s term to describe the challenges of
explanation that come with AI is Intellectual Debt.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the context of machine learning and complex systems, Jonathan
Zittrain has coined the term <a
href="https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c">“Intellectual
Debt”</a> to describe the challenge of understanding what you’ve
created. In <a
href="https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/data-oriented-architectures-for-ai-based-systems.html">the
ML@CL group we’ve been foucssing on developing the notion of a
<em>data-oriented architecture</em></a> to deal with intellectual debt
<span class="citation" data-cites="Cabrera-realworld23">(Cabrera et al.,
2023)</span>.</p>
<p>Zittrain points out the challenge around the lack of interpretability
of individual ML models as the origin of intellectual debt. In machine
learning I refer to work in this area as fairness, interpretability and
transparency or FIT models. To an extent I agree with Zittrain, but if
we understand the context and purpose of the decision making, I believe
this is readily put right by the correct monitoring and retraining
regime around the model. A concept I refer to as “progression testing”.
Indeed, the best teams do this at the moment, and their failure to do it
feels more of a matter of technical debt rather than intellectual,
because arguably it is a maintenance task rather than an explanation
task. After all, we have good statistical tools for interpreting
individual models and decisions when we have the context. We can
linearise around the operating point, we can perform counterfactual
tests on the model. We can build empirical validation sets that explore
fairness or accuracy of the model.</p>
<p>But if we can avoid the pitfalls of counterfeit people, this also
offers us an opportunity to <em>psychologically represent</em> <span
class="citation" data-cites="Heider:interpersonal58">(Heider,
1958)</span> the machine in a manner where humans can communicate
without special training. This in turn offers the opportunity to
overcome the challenge of <em>intellectual debt</em>.</p>
<p>Despite the lack of interpretability of machine learning models, they
allow us access to what the machine is doing in a way that bypasses many
of the traditional techniques developed in statistics. But understanding
this new route for access is a major new challenge.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>The probabilistic modelling community has evolved in an era where the
assumption was that ambiguous conclusions are best shared with a
(trained) professional through probabilities. Recent advances in
generative AI offer the possibility of machines that have a better
understanding of human subjective ambiguities and therefore machines
that can summarise information in a way that can be interogated rather
than just through a series of numbers.</p>
