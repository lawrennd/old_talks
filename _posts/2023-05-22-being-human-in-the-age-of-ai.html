title: "Being Human in the Age of AI"
venue: "Pint of Science, Cambridge"
abstract: "<p>Waves of automation have driven human advance, and each
wave requires humans to adapt to the machine.The promise of AI is to be
the first wave of automation that will adapt to us.</p>
<p>As this promise seems to be coming close to being fulfilled we are
seeing that the machine is gaining new capabilities that we previously
thought of as unique to us, so where does this leave the human being in
the age of AI?</p>
<p>In this talk Neil will argue that rather than supplanting our
intelligence, AI provides a new lens with which we can better understand
ourselves. He’ll argue that rather than our identity being driven by our
capabilities, its driven by our limitations and fragilities. And that if
we take this seriously we see that the real role of AI can be not to
make us transhuman, but more human.</p>"
