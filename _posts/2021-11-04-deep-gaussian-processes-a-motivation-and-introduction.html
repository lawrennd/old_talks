title: "Deep Gaussian Processes: A Motivation and Introduction"
venue: "LG Distinguished Talk"
abstract: "<p>Modern machine learning methods have driven significant advances in artificial intelligence, with notable examples coming from Deep Learning, enabling super-human performance in the game of Go and highly accurate prediction of protein folding e.g. AlphaFold. In this talk we look at deep learning from the perspective of Gaussian processes. Deep Gaussian processes extend the notion of deep learning to propagate uncertainty alongside function values. We’ll explain why this is important and show some simple examples.</p>"

<p>The fourth industrial revolution bears the particular hallmark of being the first revolution that has been named before it has happened. This is particularly unfortunate, because it is not in fact an industrial revolution at all. Nor is it necessarily a distinct phenomenon. It is part of a revolution in information, one that goes back to digitisation and the invention of the silicon chip.</p>
<p>Or to put it more precisely, it is a revolution in how information can affect the physical world. The interchange between information and the physical world.</p>

<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a combination of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> a function which is used to make the predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness, spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> a function which defines the cost of misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world’s generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and the objective function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the acdemic field of machine learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring different types of models and data together.</p>
<p>A useful reference for state of the art in machine learning is the UK Royal Society Report, <a href="https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf">Machine Learning: Power and Promise of Computers that Learn by Example</a>.</p>

<p>Any process of automation allows us to scale what we do by codifying a process in some way that makes it efficient and repeatable. Machine learning automates by emulating human (or other actions) found in data. Machine learning codifies in the form of a mathematical function that is learnt by a computer. If we can create these mathematical functions in ways in which they can interconnect, then we can also build systems.</p>
<p>Machine learning works through codifing a prediction of interest into a mathematical function. For example, we can try and predict the probability that a customer wants to by a jersey given knowledge of their age, and the latitude where they live. The technique known as logistic regression estimates the odds that someone will by a jumper as a linear weighted sum of the features of interest.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \text{odds} = \frac{p(\text{bought})}{p(\text{not bought})} \]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ \log \text{odds}  = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} + \beta_2 \text{latitude}.\]</span> Here <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> are the parameters of the model. If <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta_2\)</span> are both positive, then the log-odds that someone will buy a jumper increase with increasing latitude and age, so the further north you are and the older you are the more likely you are to buy a jumper. The parameter <span class="math inline">\(\beta_0\)</span> is an offset parameter, and gives the log-odds of buying a jumper at zero age and on the equator. It is likely to be negative<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> indicating that the purchase is odds-against. This is actually a classical statistical model, and models like logistic regression are widely used to estimate probabilities from ad-click prediction to risk of disease.</p>
<p>This is called a generalized linear model, we can also think of it as estimating the <em>probability</em> of a purchase as a nonlinear function of the features (age, lattitude) and the parameters (the <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> values). The function is known as the <em>sigmoid</em> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logistic function</a>, thus the name <em>logistic</em> regression.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p(\text{bought}) =  \sigma\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{age} + \beta_2 \text{latitude}\right).\]</span> In the case where we have <em>features</em> to help us predict, we sometimes denote such features as a vector, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}\)</span>, and we then use an inner product between the features and the parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{ x}= \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \beta_3 x_3 ...\)</span>, to represent the argument of the sigmoid.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ p(\text{bought}) =  \sigma\left(\boldsymbol{\beta}^\top \mathbf{ x}\right).\]</span> More generally, we aim to predict some aspect of our data, <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, by relating it through a mathematical function, <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span>, to the parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)</span> and the data, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{ x}\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[ y=  f\left(\mathbf{ x}, \boldsymbol{\beta}\right).\]</span> We call <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> the <em>prediction function</em>.</p>
<p>To obtain the fit to data, we use a separate function called the <em>objective function</em> that gives us a mathematical representation of the difference between our predictions and the real data.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X})\]</span> A commonly used examples (for example in a regression problem) is least squares, <span class="math display">\[E(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \mathbf{Y}, \mathbf{X}) = \sum_{i=1}^n\left(y_i - f(\mathbf{ x}_i, \boldsymbol{\beta})\right)^2.\]</span></p>
<p>If a linear prediction function is combined with the least squares objective function then that gives us a classical <em>linear regression</em>, another classical statistical model. Statistics often focusses on linear models because it makes interpretation of the model easier. Interpretation is key in statistics because the aim is normally to validate questions by analysis of data. Machine learning has typically focussed more on the prediction function itself and worried less about the interpretation of parameters, which are normally denoted by <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}\)</span> instead of <span class="math inline">\(\boldsymbol{\beta}\)</span>. As a result <em>non-linear</em> functions are explored more often as they tend to improve quality of predictions but at the expense of interpretability.</p>

</div>
<p>Classical statistical models and simple machine learning models have a great deal in common. The main difference between the fields is philosophical. Machine learning practitioners are typically more concerned with the quality of prediciton (e.g. measured by ROC curve) while statisticians tend to focus more on the interpretability of the model and the validity of any decisions drawn from that interpretation. For example, a statistical model may be used to validate whether a large scale intervention (such as the mass provision of mosquito nets) has had a long term effect on disease (such as malaria). In this case one of the covariates is likely to be the provision level of nets in a particular region. The response variable would be the rate of malaria disease in the region. The parmaeter, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> associated with that covariate will demonstrate a positive or negative effect which would be validated in answering the question. The focus in statistics would be less on the accuracy of the response variable and more on the validity of the interpretation of the effect variable, <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span>.</p>
<p>A machine learning practitioner on the other hand would typically denote the parameter <span class="math inline">\(w_1\)</span>, instead of <span class="math inline">\(\beta_1\)</span> and would only be interested in the output of the prediction function, <span class="math inline">\(f(\cdot)\)</span> rather than the parameter itself. The general formalism of the prediction function allows for <em>non-linear</em> models. In machine learning, the emphasis on prediction over interpretability means that non-linear models are often used. The parameters, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{w}\)</span>, are a means to an end (good prediction) rather than an end in themselves (interpretable).</p>

<p>Figure: Deep learning models are composition of simple functions. We can think of a pinball machine as an analogy. Each layer of pins corresponds to one of the layers of functions in the model. Input data is represented by the location of the ball from left to right when it is dropped in from the top. Output class comes from the position of the ball as it leaves the pins at the bottom.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Sometimes deep learning models are described as being like the brain, or too complex to understand, but one analogy I find useful to help the gist of these models is to think of them as being similar to early pin ball machines.</p>
<p>In a deep neural network, we input a number (or numbers), whereas in pinball, we input a ball.</p>
<p>Think of the location of the ball on the left-right axis as a single number. Our simple pinball machine can only take one number at a time. As the ball falls through the machine, each layer of pins can be thought of as a different layer of ‘neurons.’ Each layer acts to move the ball from left to right.</p>
<p>In a pinball machine, when the ball gets to the bottom it might fall into a hole defining a score, in a neural network, that is equivalent to the decision: a classification of the input object.</p>
<p>An image has more than one number associated with it, so it is like playing pinball in a <em>hyper-space</em>.</p>

<p>Learning involves moving all the pins to be in the correct position, so that the ball ends up in the right place when it’s fallen through the machine. But moving all these pins in hyperspace can be difficult.</p>
<p>In a hyper-space you have to put a lot of data through the machine for to explore the positions of all the pins. Even when you feed many millions of data points through the machine, there are likely to be regions in the hyper-space where no ball has passed. When future test data passes through the machine in a new route unusual things can happen.</p>
<p><em>Adversarial examples</em> exploit this high dimensional space. If you have access to the pinball machine, you can use gradient methods to find a position for the ball in the hyper space where the image looks like one thing, but will be classified as another.</p>
<p>Probabilistic methods explore more of the space by considering a range of possible paths for the ball through the machine. This helps to make them more data efficient and gives some robustness to adversarial examples.</p>

<p>In practice, we normally also have uncertainty associated with these functions. Uncertainty in the prediction function arises from</p>

<p>One view of Bayesian inference is to assume we are given a mechanism for generating samples, where we assume that mechanism is representing on accurate view on the way we believe the world works.</p>
<p>This mechanism is known as our <em>prior</em> belief.</p>
<p>We combine our prior belief with our observations of the real world by discarding all those samples that are inconsistent with our prior. The <em>likelihood</em> defines mathematically what we mean by inconsistent with the prior. The higher the noise level in the likelihood, the looser the notion of consistent.</p>
<p>The samples that remain are samples from the <em>posterior</em>.</p>
<p>This approach to Bayesian inference is closely related to two sampling techniques known as <em>rejection sampling</em> and <em>importance sampling</em>. It is realized in practice in an approach known as <em>approximate Bayesian computation</em> (ABC) or likelihood-free inference.</p>
<p>In practice, the algorithm is often too slow to be practical, because most samples will be inconsistent with the data and as a result the mechanism must be operated many times to obtain a few posterior samples.</p>
<p>However, in the Gaussian process case, when the likelihood also assumes Gaussian noise, we can operate this mechanism mathematically, and obtain the posterior density <em>analytically</em>. This is the benefit of Gaussian processes.</p>
<p>First, we will load in two python functions for computing the covariance function.</p>
<p>Next, we sample from a multivariate normal density (a multivariate Gaussian), using the covariance function as the covariance matrix.</p>

<p>Even in the early days of Gaussian processes in machine learning, it was understood that we were throwing something fundamental away. This is perhaps captured best by David MacKay in his 1997 NeurIPS tutorial on Gaussian processes, where he asked “Have we thrown out the baby with the bathwater?” The quote below is from his summarization paper.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>According to the hype of 1987, neural networks were meant to be intelligent models which discovered features and patterns in data. Gaussian processes in contrast are simply smoothing devices. How can Gaussian processes possibly replace neural networks? What is going on?</p>

<p>One potential problem is that as the number of nodes in two adjacent layers increases, the number of parameters in the affine transformation between layers, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{W}\)</span>, increases. If there are <span class="math inline">\(k_{i-1}\)</span> nodes in one layer, and <span class="math inline">\(k_i\)</span> nodes in the following, then that matrix contains <span class="math inline">\(k_i k_{i-1}\)</span> parameters, when we have layer widths in the 1000s that leads to millions of parameters.</p>
<p>One proposed solution is known as <em>dropout</em> where only a sub-set of the neural network is trained at each iteration.

<p>If the result of composing many functions together is simply another function, then why do we bother? The key point is that we can change the class of functions we are modeling by composing in this manner. A Gaussian process is specifying a prior over functions, and one with a number of elegant properties. For example, the derivative process (if it exists) of a Gaussian process is also Gaussian distributed. That makes it easy to assimilate, for example, derivative observations. But that also might raise some alarm bells. That implies that the <em>marginal derivative distribution</em> is also Gaussian distributed. If that’s the case, then it means that functions which occasionally exhibit very large derivatives are hard to model with a Gaussian process. For example, a function with jumps in.</p>
<p>A one off discontinuity is easy to model with a Gaussian process, or even multiple discontinuities. They can be introduced in the mean function, or independence can be forced between two covariance functions that apply in different areas of the input space. But in these cases we will need to specify the number of discontinuities and where they occur. In otherwords we need to <em>parameterise</em> the discontinuities. If we do not know the number of discontinuities and don’t wish to specify where they occur, i.e. if we want a non-parametric representation of discontinuities, then the standard Gaussian process doesn’t help.</p>
<h2 id="stochastic-process-composition-1">Stochastic Process Composition</h2>
<p>The deep Gaussian process leads to <em>non-Gaussian</em> models, and non-Gaussian characteristics in the covariance function. In effect, what we are proposing is that we change the properties of the functions we are considering by <em>composing stochastic processes</em>. This is an approach to creating new stochastic processes from well known processes.</p>
<p>Additionally, we are not constrained to the formalism of the chain. For example, we can easily add single nodes emerging from some point in the depth of the chain. This allows us to combine the benefits of the graphical modelling formalism, but with a powerful framework for relating one set of variables to another, that of Gaussian processes</p>

<p>GPy is a BSD licensed software code base for implementing Gaussian process models in python. This allows GPs to be combined with a wide variety of software libraries.</p>
<p>The software itself is available on <a href="https://github.com/SheffieldML/GPy">GitHub</a> and the team welcomes contributions.</p>
<p>The aim for GPy is to be a probabilistic-style programming language, i.e., you specify the model rather than the algorithm. As well as a large range of covariance functions the software allows for non-Gaussian likelihoods, multivariate outputs, dimensionality reduction and approximations for larger data sets.</p>
<p>The documentation for GPy can be found <a href="https://gpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">here</a>.</p>
<p>This notebook depends on PyDeepGP. This library can be installed via pip.</p>

<p>Things to notice about the data include the outlier in 1904, in this year, the olympics was in St Louis, USA. Organizational problems and challenges with dust kicked up by the cars following the race meant that participants got lost, and only very few participants completed.</p>
<p>More recent years see more consistently quick marathons.</p>

<p>If we had to summarise the objectives of machine learning in one word, a very good candidate for that word would be <em>generalization</em>. What is generalization? From a human perspective it might be summarised as the ability to take lessons learned in one domain and apply them to another domain. If we accept the definition given in the first session for machine learning, <span class="math display">\[
\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}
\]</span> then we see that without a model we can’t generalise: we only have data. Data is fine for answering very specific questions, like “Who won the Olympic Marathon in 2012?” because we have that answer stored, however, we are not given the answer to many other questions. For example, Alan Turing was a formidable marathon runner, in 1946 he ran a time 2 hours 46 minutes (just under four minutes per kilometer, faster than I and most of the other <a href="http://www.parkrun.org.uk/sheffieldhallam/">Endcliffe Park Run</a> runners can do 5 km). What is the probability he would have won an Olympics if one had been held in 1946?</p>
<p>To answer this question we need to generalize, but before we formalize the concept of generalization let’s introduce some formal representation of what it means to generalize in machine learning.</p>

<p>Let’s see if a deep Gaussian process can help here. We will construct a deep Gaussian process with one hidden layer (i.e. one Gaussian process feeding into another).</p>
<p>Build a Deep GP with an additional hidden layer (one dimensional) to fit the model.</p>

<p>Figure: A pinball plot shows the movement of the ‘ball’ as it passes through each layer of the Gaussian processes. Mean directions of movement are shown by lines. Shading gives one standard deviation of movement position. At each layer, the uncertainty is reset. The overal uncertainty is the cumulative uncertainty from all the layers. There is some grouping of later points towards the right in the first layer, which also injects a large amount of uncertainty. Due to flattening of the curve in the second layer towards the right the uncertainty is reduced in final output.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>The pinball plot shows the flow of any input ball through the deep Gaussian process. In a pinball plot a series of vertical parallel lines would indicate a purely linear function. For the olypmic marathon data we can see the first layer begins to shift from input towards the right. Note it also does so with some uncertainty (indicated by the shaded backgrounds). The second layer has less uncertainty, but bunches the inputs more strongly to the right. This input layer of uncertainty, followed by a layer that pushes inputs to the right is what gives the heteroschedastic noise.</p>

<p>The resulting fit to the step function data shows some challenges. In particular, the over smoothing at the discontinuity. If we know how many discontinuities there are, we can parameterize them in the step function. But by doing this, we form a semi-parametric model. The parameters indicate how many discontinuities are, and where they are. They can be optimized as part of the model fit. But if new, unforeseen, discontinuities arise when the model is being deployed in practice, these won’t be accounted for in the predictions.</p>

<p>First we initialize a deep Gaussian process with three latent layers (four layers total). Within each layer we create a GP with an exponentiated quadratic covariance (<code>GPy.kern.RBF</code>).</p>

<h2 id="initialization">Initialization</h2>
<p>Just like deep neural networks, there are some tricks to intitializing these models. The tricks we use here include some early training of the model with model parameters constrained. This gives the variational inducing parameters some scope to tighten the bound for the case where the noise variance is small and the variances of the Gaussian processes are around 1.</p>

<p>A very promising idea was recently presented by <span class="citation" data-cites="Dutordoir-deepnns21">Dutordoir et al. (2021)</span>. They note that the ReLU activiation functions we use in the neural network can be seen as the consequence of a basis function defined on a circle (or a hypersphere in higher dimensions) being projected onto the real line (or hyperplane) as show in Figure . This allows them to construct a covariance function on the hypersphere that is <em>stationary</em>.</p>

<p>From a machine learning perspective, we’d like to be able to interrelate all the different modalities that are informative about the state of the disease. For deep health, the notion is that the state of the disease is appearing at the more abstract levels, as we descend the model, we express relationships between the more abstract concept, that sits within the physician’s mind, and the data we can measure.</p>
