title: "Decision Making in the Era of Generative AI"
venue: "Healthy Lifespan Institute Annual Meeting"
abstract: "The excitement around large language models such as ChatGPT
has led to great enthusiasm about the possibilities for computer aided
decision making across the professions. In this talk, we will look at
why these models are important and speculate on how they may help and
hinder progress in automated decision making."

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction

</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>We have already seen the effects of this changed dynamic in biology
and computational biology. Improved sensorics have led to the new
domains of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and ‘rich phenomics’ as well as
considerably augmenting our capabilities in genomics.</p>
<p>Biologists have had to become data-savvy, they require a rich
understanding of the available data resources and need to assimilate
existing data sets in their hypothesis generation as well as their
experimental design. Modern biology has become a far more quantitative
science, but the quantitativeness has required new methods developed in
the domains of <em>computational biology</em> and
<em>bioinformatics</em>.</p>
<p>There is also great promise for personalized health, but in health
the wide data-sharing that has underpinned success in the computational
biology community is much harder to carry out.</p>
<p>We can expect to see these phenomena reflected in wider society.
Particularly as we make use of more automated decision making based only
on data. This is leading to a requirement to better understand our own
subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface allows
domain experts to assimilate data driven conclusions in a well
calibrated manner. This is particularly important where medical
treatments are being prescribed. It also offers potential for different
kinds of medical intervention. More subtle interventions are possible
when the digital environment is able to respond to users in an bespoke
manner. This has particular implications for treatment of mental health
conditions.</p>
<p>The main phenomenon we see across the board is the shift in dynamic
from the direct pathway between human and data, as traditionally
mediated by classical statistics, to a new flow of information via the
computer. This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging
domain of <em>data science</em>, where the interactions between human
and data are mediated by the machine.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics</p>
<p>Benjamin Disraeli 1804-1881</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Benjamin Disraeli said<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a> that there three types of lies:
lies, damned lies and statistics. Disraeli died in 1881, 30 years before
the first academic department of applied statistics was founded at UCL.
If Disraeli were alive today, it is likely that he’d rephrase his
quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are three types of lies, lies damned lies and <em>big
data</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why? Because the challenges of understanding and interpreting big
data today are similar to those that Disraeli faced in governing an
empire through statistics in the latter part of the 19th century.</p>
<p>The quote lies, damned lies and statistics was credited to Benjamin
Disraeli by Mark Twain in his autobiography. It characterizes the idea
that statistic can be made to prove anything. But Disraeli died in 1881
and Mark Twain died in 1910. The important breakthrough in overcoming
our tendency to over-interpet data came with the formalization of the
field through the development of <em>mathematical statistics</em>.</p>
<p>Data has an elusive quality, it promises so much but can deliver
little, it can mislead and misrepresent. To harness it, it must be
tamed. In Disraeli’s time during the second half of the 19th century,
numbers and data were being accumulated, the social sciences were being
developed. There was a large-scale collection of data for the purposes
of government.</p>
<p>The modern ‘big data era’ is on the verge of delivering the same
sense of frustration that Disraeli experienced, the early promise of big
data as a panacea is evolving to demands for delivery. For me,
personally, peak-hype coincided with an email I received inviting
collaboration on a project to deploy “<em>Big Data</em> and <em>Internet
of Things</em> in an <em>Industry 4.0</em> environment”. Further
questioning revealed that the actual project was optimization of the
efficiency of a manufacturing production line, a far more tangible and
<em>realizable</em> goal.</p>
<p>The antidote to this verbiage is found in increasing awareness. When
dealing with data the first trap to avoid is the games of buzzword bingo
that we are wont to play. The first goal is to quantify what challenges
can be addressed and what techniques are required. Behind the hype
fundamentals are changing. The phenomenon is about the increasing access
we have to data. The way customers’ information is recorded and
processes are codified and digitized with little overhead. Internet of
things is about the increasing number of cheap sensors that can be
easily interconnected through our modern network structures. But
businesses are about making money, and these phenomena need to be recast
in those terms before their value can be realized.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-statistics"><em>Mathematical</em> Statistics</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Pearson">Karl Pearson</a>
(1857-1936), <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ronald_Fisher">Ronald Fisher</a>
(1890-1962) and others considered the question of what conclusions can
truly be drawn from data. Their mathematical studies act as a restraint
on our tendency to over-interpret and see patterns where there are none.
They introduced concepts such as randomized control trials that form a
mainstay of our decision making today, from government, to clinicians to
large scale A/B testing that determines the nature of the web interfaces
we interact with on social media and shopping.</p>

<p>Their movement did the most to put statistics to rights, to eradicate
the ‘damned lies’. It was known as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_statistics">‘mathematical
statistics’</a>. Today I believe we should look to the emerging field of
<em>data science</em> to provide the same role. Data science is an
amalgam of statistics, data mining, computer systems, databases,
computation, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Spread across
these fields are the tools we need to realize data’s potential. For many
businesses this might be thought of as the challenge of ‘converting bits
into atoms’. Bits: the data stored on computer, atoms: the physical
manifestation of what we do; the transfer of goods, the delivery of
service. From fungible to tangible. When solving a challenge through
data there are a series of obstacles that need to be addressed.</p>
<p>Firstly, data awareness: what data you have and where its stored.
Sometimes this includes changing your conception of what data is and how
it can be obtained. From automated production lines to apps on employee
smart phones. Often data is locked away: manual logbooks, confidential
data, personal data. For increasing awareness an internal audit can
help. The website <a href="https://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk</a> hosts
data made available by the UK government. To create this website the
government’s departments went through an audit of what data they each
hold and what data they could make available. Similarly, within private
busnesses this type of audit could be useful for understanding their
internal digital landscape: after all the key to any successful campaign
is a good map.</p>
<p>Secondly, availability. How well are the data sources interconnected?
How well curated are they? The curse of Disraeli was associated with
unreliable data and <em>unreliable statistics</em>. The
misrepresentations this leads to are worse than the absence of data as
they give a false sense of confidence to decision making. Understanding
how to avoid these pitfalls involves an improved sense of data and its
value, one that needs to permeate the organization.</p>
<p>The final challenge is analysis, the accumulation of the necessary
expertise to digest what the data tells us. Data requires
interpretation, and interpretation requires experience. Analysis is
providing a bottleneck due to a skill shortage, a skill shortage made
more acute by the fact that, ideally, analysis should be carried out by
individuals not only skilled in data science but also equipped with the
domain knowledge to understand the implications in a given application,
and to see opportunities for improvements in efficiency.</p>
<h2 id="mathematical-data-science">‘Mathematical Data Science’</h2>
<p>As a term ‘big data’ promises much and delivers little, to get true
value from data, it needs to be curated and evaluated. The three stages
of awareness, availability and analysis provide a broad framework
through which organizations should be assessing the potential in the
data they hold. Hand waving about big data solutions will not do, it
will only lead to self-deception. The castles we build on our data
landscapes must be based on firm foundations, process and scientific
analysis. If we do things right, those are the foundations that will be
provided by the new field of data science.</p>
<p>Today the statement “There are three types of lies: lies, damned lies
and ‘big data’” may be more apt. We are revisiting many of the mistakes
made in interpreting data from the 19th century. Big data is laid down
by happenstance, rather than actively collected with a particular
question in mind. That means it needs to be treated with care when
conclusions are being drawn. For data science to succeed it needs the
same form of rigor that Pearson and Fisher brought to statistics, a
“mathematical data science” is needed.</p>

<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>

communicated a story through simple facets such as their relative

<p>Figure: Consider the six-word novel, apocryphally credited to Ernest
Hemingway, “For sale: baby shoes, never worn”. To understand what that
means to a human, you need a great deal of additional context. Context
that is not directly accessible to a machine that has not got both the
evolved and contextual understanding of our own condition to realize
both the implication of the advert and what that implication means
emotionally to the previous owner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>But this is a very different kind of intelligence than ours. A
computer cannot understand the depth of the Ernest Hemingway’s
apocryphal six-word novel: “For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never worn”, because
it isn’t equipped with that ability to model the complexity of humanity
that underlies that statement.</p>

<p>Similarly, we find it difficult to comprehend how computers are
making decisions. Because they do so with more data than we can possibly
imagine.</p>
<p>In many respects, this is not a problem, it’s a good thing. Computers
and us are good at different things. But when we interact with a
computer, when it acts in a different way to us, we need to remember
why.</p>
<p>Just as the first step to getting along with other humans is
understanding other humans, so it needs to be with getting along with
our computers.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors explain why, at the same time, computers are so
impressive in simulating our weather, but so poor at predicting our
moods. Our complexity is greater than that of our weather, and each of
us is tuned to read and respond to one another.</p>
<p>Their intelligence is different. It is based on very large quantities
of data that we cannot absorb. Our computers don’t have a complex
internal model of who we are. They don’t understand the human condition.
They are not tuned to respond to us as we are to each other.</p>
<p>Embodiment factors encapsulate a profound thing about the nature of
humans. Our locked in intelligence means that we are striving to
communicate, so we put a lot of thought into what we’re communicating
with. And if we’re communicating with something complex, we naturally
anthropomorphize them.</p>
<p>We give our dogs, our cats, and our cars human motivations. We do the
same with our computers. We anthropomorphize them. We assume that they
have the same objectives as us and the same constraints. They don’t.</p>
<p>This means, that when we worry about artificial intelligence, we
worry about the wrong things. We fear computers that behave like more
powerful versions of ourselves that will struggle to outcompete us.</p>
<p>In reality, the challenge is that our computers cannot be human
enough. They cannot understand us with the depth we understand one
another. They drop below our cognitive radar and operate outside our
mental models.</p>
<p>The real danger is that computers don’t anthropomorphize. They’ll
make decisions in isolation from us without our supervision because they
can’t communicate truly and deeply with us.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don’t always have time to wait for this process to
converge to an answer we can all rely on before a decision is

<p>Not only can we be misled by data before a decision is made, but
sometimes we can be misled by data to justify the making of a decision.

As an exercise in understanding complexity, watch the following video. You will see the basketball being bounced around, and the players moving. Your job is to count the passes of those dressed in white and ignore those of the individuals dressed in black.

</div>
</div>

In a classic study @Simons-gorillas99 ask subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these subjects don't notice the gorilla moving across the scene.

The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö Bálint,

> It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.
>
> Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)


When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other (potentially vital) contextual information.

This phenomenon is known as selective attention or 'inattentional blindness'.

<p>We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning, but
need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field machine
learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle some complex,
‘real world’ problems.</p>
<p>It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has started
the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new Programme is
seeking to support researchers across the University to develop the
skills they need to be able to use machine learning and AI in their
research.</p>
<p>To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops and
applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific challenges,
with three Accelerate Research fellows working directly on issues
relating to computational biology, psychiatry, and string theory. While
we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for now, in the longer term our
ambition is to build links with the social sciences and humanities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Recruited a core research team working on the application of AI
in mental health, bioinformatics, healthcare, string theory, and complex
systems.</p></li>
<li><p>Created a research agenda and roadmap for the development of AI
in science.</p></li>
<li><p>Funded 9 interdisciplinary projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Antimicrobial resistance in farming</p></li>
<li><p>Quantifying Design Trade-offs in Electricity-generation-focused
Tokamaks using AI</p></li>
<li><p>Automated preclinical drug discovery in vivo using pose
estimation</p></li>
<li><p>Causal Methods for Environmental Science Workshop</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic tree mapping in Cambridge</p></li>
<li><p>Acoustic monitoring for biodiversity conservation</p></li>
<li><p>AI, mathematics and string theory</p></li>
<li><p>Theoretical, Scientific, and Philosophical Perspectives on
Biological Understanding in the age of Artificial Intelligence</p></li>
<li><p>AI in pathology: optimising a classifier for digital images of
duodenal biopsies</p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities
already delivered through University courses, we’re creating a pipeline
of learning opportunities to help PhD students and postdocs better
understand how to use data science and machine learning in their
work.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<p>Teaching and learning</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Brought over 250 participants from over 30 departments through
tailored data science and machine learning for science training (Data
Science Residency and Machine Learning Academy);</p></li>
<li><p>Convened workshops with over 80 researchers across the University
on the development of data pipelines for science;</p></li>
<li><p>Delivered University courses to over 100 students in Advanced
Data Science and Machine Learning and the Physical World.</p></li>
<li><p>Online training course in Python and Pandas accessed by over 380
researchers.</p></li>
<li><p>Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community
of researchers working across the University at the interface on machine
learning and the sciences, helping to share best practice and new
methods, and support each other in advancing their research. Over the
coming years, we’ll be running a variety of events and activities in
support of this.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Launched a Machine Learning Engineering Clinic that has supported
over 40 projects across the University with MLE troubleshooting and
advice;</p></li>
<li><p>Hosted and participated in events reaching over 300 people in
Cambridge;</p></li>
<li><p>Led international workshops at Dagstuhl and Oberwolfach,
convening over 60 leading researchers;</p></li>
<li><p>Engaged over 70 researchers through outreach sessions and
workshops with the School of Clinical Medicine, the Faculty of
Education, Cambridge Digital Humanities and the School of Biological
Sciences.</p></li>

<p>Recent years have brought a lot of excitement about artificial
intelligence, and its potential to revolutionise research.</p>
<p>In some disciplines, machine learning is already supporting
impressive advances. Just this week, for example, we’ve seen headlines
about new work by DeepMind, using machine learning to predict patterns
of protein folding – an advance that could unlock the development of a
range of new drugs to treat different diseases.</p>
<p>In other areas, there is clear potential for machine learning to make
a contribution, but current tools and techniques aren’t being used as
widely as they could be.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>One of biology’s biggest mysteries is how proteins fold to create
exquisitely unique three-dimensional structures. Every living thing –
from the smallest bacteria to plants, animals and humans – is defined
and powered by the proteins that help it function at the molecular
level.</p>
<p>So far, this mystery remained unsolved, and determining a single
protein structure often required years of experimental effort. It’s
tremendous to see the triumph of human curiosity, endeavour and
intelligence in solving this problem. A better understanding of protein
structures and the ability to predict them using a computer means a
better understanding of life, evolution and, of course, human health and
disease.</p>
