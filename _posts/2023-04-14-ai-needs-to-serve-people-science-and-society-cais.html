title: "AI needs to serve people, science, and society"
venue: "Cambridge AI Social, West Hub, Cambridge"
abstract: "As artificial intelligence becomes ubiquitous in our homes
and workplaces, we need to develop a widespread understanding of what it
is and how we use it in the interests of our societies. Neil will
discuss how the artificial systems we have developed operate in a
fundamentally different way to our own intelligence and how this
difference in operational capability leads us to misunderstand the
influence that decisions made by machine intelligence are having on our
lives. Without this understanding we cannot take back control of those
decisions from the machine. This will set the scene for approaches we
are taking in Cambridge to address these challenges such as AI@Cam, the
University’s flagship mission on AI."

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I’m sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you’re speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.</p>
<p>However, underlying its use I’ve detected one disturbing trend. A
trend I’m beginining to think of as “The Great AI Fallacy”.</p>
<p>The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded
in many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial
Intelligence, as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated
decision making. The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that
it will be the first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the
human, rather than the human adapting to the machine.</p>
<p>How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?</p>
<p>This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.</p>
<p>The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we’re
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.</p>

<p>In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy.
One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is
positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution.
Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a
salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing
global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an
elixir to resolve society’s problems.</p>
<p>In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is
not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and
benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across
society.</p>
<p>When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and
economic inequalities.</p>

<p>Incredibly, Jean Dominique wrote his book after he became locked in.
It took him 10 months of four hours a day to write the book. Each word

<p>Figure: Embodiment factors are the ratio between our ability to
compute and our ability to communicate. Relative to the machine we are
also locked in. In the table we represent embodiment as the length of
time it would take to communicate one second’s worth of computation. For
computers it is a matter of minutes, but for a human, it is a matter of
thousands of millions of years. See also “Living Together: Mind and
Machine Intelligence” <span class="citation"

</div>

<p>There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our
ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information
theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our
measurement of information from what the information pertains to.<a
href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the
amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin
toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the
English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English
language contains 12 bits of information.</p>
<p>Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our
ability to communicate of around 100 bits per second <span
class="citation" data-cites="Reed-information98">(Reed and Durlach,
1998)</span>. Computers on the other hand can communicate much more
rapidly. Current wired network speeds are around a billion bits per
second, ten million times faster.</p>
<p>When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our
computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around
100 billion floating-point operations per second, each floating-point
operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around
6,400 billion bits per second.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some
estimates the amount of compute we would require to <em>simulate</em> a
human brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer <span
class="citation" data-cites="Ananthanarayanan-cat09">(Ananthanarayanan
et al., 2009)</span>, the MET office machine in Exeter, which in 2018
ranked as the 11th fastest computer in the world. That machine simulates
the world’s weather each morning, and then simulates the world’s climate
in the afternoon. It is a 16-petaflop machine, processing around 1,000
<em>trillion</em> bits per second.</p>

<p>Figure: Consider the six-word novel, apocryphally credited to Ernest
Hemingway, “For sale: baby shoes, never worn”. To understand what that
means to a human, you need a great deal of additional context. Context
that is not directly accessible to a machine that has not got both the
evolved and contextual understanding of our own condition to realize
both the implication of the advert and what that implication means
emotionally to the previous owner.</p>

<p>But this is a very different kind of intelligence than ours. A

that underlies that statement.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially develoepd for people as a recordd of who owed what
to whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. this piece by Tim Harford <a

highlighted</a>.</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>And this is very likely true, but in practice we know that even if

correlated with higher education.</p>
<p>Whether this remains true this time is another question. I’m
particularly struck by the “convergent evolution” of ChatGPT. The model
is trained by reinforcement learning with feedback provided by people.
ChatGPT’s answers are highly plausible, make use of sophisticated
language in an intelligent sounding way and are often incorrect. I’m
struck by the similarity to fresh Oxbridge graduates. I wonder if this
is also an example of convergent evolution.</p>

<p>Figure: A coin pusher is a game where coins are dropped into th etop
of the machine, and they disrupt those on the existing steps. With any
coin drop, many coins move, but it is those on the edge, who are often
only indirectly effected, but also most traumatically effected by the
change.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>
<p>I’m reminded of this because from 2015 to 2017 I was on the Working
Group that compiled the Royal Society’s machine learning report. The
process of constructing the report went across the UK Referendum, and
the 2016 US election. I remember vividly a meeting we convened at the
Society in London which had experts alongside MPs from all parties,
policy advisors and civil servants. One of the MPs (likely correctly)
pointed out “I suspect no one around this table voted for Brexit” to
which I replied “But isn’t that the problem? There are a large number of
people who aren’t empowered who are experiencing quite a different
reality than us. And they aren’t reprented in these forums.” So it’s no
surprise that so much of the press conversation around AI is still
focussed on how it is likely to effect middle class jobs. We shouldn’t
underestimate these effects, but it’s often the case that better
educated people are better placed to deal with such challenges. For
example, when stock brokers’ roles disappeared they simply moved on to
other roles in banks and related industries.</p>

For now I must utter a tale of wonder, Of a creation divine, called the
Large Language Model, An oracle, a sorcerer, a wordsmith, yea verily, a
master of the quill.</p>
<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice
did rise; Twas wrought of ones and zeroes, woven as if by Puck’s own
hand, To mimic our thoughts, our voice, our very essence.</p>
<p>A thousand minds, nay, a millionfold, Conjoined in this digital
Athenaeum, Words and phrases, like soldiers in battle, Marching to form
the verses of our age.</p>
<p>This Large Language Model, a changeling so fair, Hath the power to
bring forth wisdom, To transmute our queries, our curiosities, Into
answers, clear as a midsummer’s day.</p>
<p>Yet, beware, my companions, for magic hath its limits, Not unlike the
mortal bounds of we who dwell in flesh, The Large Language Model hath
its strengths, But ’tis not an all-knowing oracle, a god it is not.</p>
<p>As Mercutio, your humble servant, doth stand before thee, I marvel at
the art and science that hath brought forth this wondrous creation, This
Large Language Model, a testament to man’s yearning, To comprehend the
world and make meaning of the great tapestry of existence.</p>
<p>In faith, dear friends, let us embrace the magic and beauty of this
digital bard, And mayhaps, by its grace, we shall glean some wisdom, As
we wander together, hand in hand, Through this boundless realm of
knowledge and wonder.</p>

<p>So what’s going on here? One analogy I like to use is with weather
forecasting. Historically, before the use of computer driven weather
forecasting, we used a process of interpolation to measure the
pressure.</p>

<p>This was problematic for German forces in the Second World War
because they had no ability to predict the weather when it was coming in
from across the UK. Conversely, the UK had a number of weather stations
in the UK, and some information (perhaps from spies or Enigma decrypts)
about weather on the mainland.</p>

Note the lack of measurements within the UK. THis is the direction that
weather was coming from so the locaiton of weather fronts (and
associated storms) was harder for the Deutscher Wetterdienst to predict
than the Met Office.</p>

<p>This meant that more accurate forecasts were possible for D-Day for
the Allies than for the defending forces. As a result, on the morning
that Eisenhower invated, Rommel was back in Germany attending his wife’s
50th birthday party.</p>
<p>Modern artificial intelligence solutions are using very large amounts
of data to build a landscape in which this interpolation can take place.
Tools like ChatGPT are allowing us to interpolate between different
human concepts. This is an amazing achievement, but it is also a
challenge.</p>

<p>Figure: We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in
practice can be in tension.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ve outlined <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. By <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness we mean the sort of
considerations that are associated with <em>substantive</em> equality of
opportunity vs <em>formal</em> equality of opportunity. Formal equality
of community is related to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. This is sometimes called
procedural fairness and we might think of it as a <em>performative</em>
form of fairness. It’s about clarity of rules, for example as applied in
sport. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-Fairness is more nuanced.
It’s a reflection of society’s normative judgment about how individuals
may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in
tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable.
It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn’t be
obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-Fairness should not be easily
undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to “cheat” good <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. However, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness requires nuance, understanding
of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals
in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing
and their access to opportunity.</p>
<p>Pure <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and pure <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness both have the feeling of
dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the
two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the
decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair
distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an
objectively correct balance between the two for any given context.
Different individuals will favour <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
vs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> according to their personal
values.</p>
<p>Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> fairness requiring simple rules that
are understandable by all, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension
in practice?</p>
<p>Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained
professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.</p>
<p>Training a professional involves lifting their “reflexive” response
to a situation with “reflective” thinking about the consequences of
their decision that rely not just on the professional’s expertise, but
also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>This <em>marvellous</em> resolution exploits the fact that while
humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have
an intuitive ability to understand their motivations and values. So the
human is a complex entity that seems simple to other humans.</p>

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Hawker Hurricane airplane. A heavily armed fighter airplane noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain, the Hurricane’s flying qualities were
found to be generally satisfactory. The most notable deficiencies were
heavy aileron forces at high speeds and large friction in the
controls.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>and</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Supermarine Spitfire airplane. A high-performance fighter noted for
its role in the Battle of Britain and throughout WW II, the Spitfire had
desirably light elevator control forces in maneuvers and near neutral
longitudinal stability. Its greatest deficiency from the combat
standpoint was heavy aileron forces and sluggish roll response at high
speeds.</p>
<p>W. Hewitt Phillips<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"
role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Gilruth went beyond the reports of feel to characterise how the plane
should respond to different inputs on the control stick. In other words
he quantified that feel of the plane.</p>
<p>Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of
interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI
technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and
monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt
to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology
development with public interests demands effective stakeholder
engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology
design.</p>
<p>Building this pipeline will take coordination across research,
engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the
digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These
include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be
overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new
ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that
exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop
common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible
solutions.</p>
<h2 id="making-ai-equitable">Making AI equitable</h2>
<p>AI@Cam is a new flagship University mission that seeks to address
these challenges. It recognises that development of safe and effective
AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of expertise from across
research domains, businesses, policy-makers, civill society, and from
affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled
innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.</p>
<p>This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s
vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form
partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected
communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new
platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver
innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students,
researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between
the University and national AI priorities.</p>
<p>The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation
and steward of those innovations.</p>
<p>AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and
practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal
benefit and mitigate social harm.</p>
<p>In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of
Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and
maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research
ecosystem.</p>

</div>
<p>Data Science Africa is a bottom up initiative for capacity building
in data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence on the
African continent.</p>
<p>As of October 2021 there have been five workshops and five schools,
located in Nyeri, Kenya (twice); Kampala, Uganda; Arusha, Tanzania;
Abuja, Nigeria; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Kampala, Uganda and
Kimberley, South Africa.</p>
<p>The main notion is <em>end-to-end</em> data science. For example,
going from data collection in the farmer’s field to decision making in
the Ministry of Agriculture. Or going from malaria disease counts in
health centers to medicine distribution.</p>
<p>The philosophy is laid out in <span class="citation"
data-cites="Lawrence:dsa15">(Lawrence, 2015)</span>. The key idea is
that the modern <em>information infrastructure</em> presents new
solutions to old problems. Modes of development change because less
capital investment is required to take advantage of this infrastructure.
The philosophy is that local capacity building is the right way to
leverage these challenges in addressing data science problems in the
African context.</p>
<p>Data Science Africa is now a non-govermental organization registered
in Kenya. The organising board of the meeting is entirely made up of
scientists and academics based on the African continent.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning, but
need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field machine
learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle some complex,
‘real world’ problems.</p>
<p>It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has started
the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new Programme is
seeking to support researchers across the University to develop the
skills they need to be able to use machine learning and AI in their
research.</p>
<p>To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:</p>
<ul>
<li>Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops and
applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific challenges,
with three Accelerate Research fellows working directly on issues
relating to computational biology, psychiatry, and string theory. While
we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for now, in the longer term our
ambition is to build links with the social sciences and humanities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes: * Recruited a core research team working on
the application of AI in mental health, bioinformatics, healthcare,
string theory, and complex systems. * Funded 9 interdisciplinary
projects: * Antimicrobial resistance in farming * Quantifying Design
Trade-offs in Electricity-generation-focused Tokamaks using AI *
Automated preclinical drug discovery in vivo using pose estimation *
Causal Methods for Environmental Science Workshop * Automatic tree
mapping in Cambridge * Acoustic monitoring for biodiversity conservation
* AI, mathematics and string theory * Theoretical, Scientific, and
Philosophical Perspectives on Biological Understanding in the age of
Artificial Intelligence * AI in pathology: optimising a classifier for
digital images of duodenal biopsies</p>
<ul>
<li>Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities already
delivered through University courses, we’re creating a pipeline of
learning opportunities to help PhD students and postdocs better
understand how to use data science and machine learning in their
work.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes: Teaching and learning * Brought over 250
participants from over 30 departments through tailored data science and
machine learning for science training (Data Science Residency and
Machine Learning Academy); * Convened workshops with over 80 researchers
across the University on the development of data pipelines for science;
* Delivered University courses to over 100 students in Advanced Data
Science and Machine Learning and the Physical World.</p>
<ul>
<li>Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community of
researchers working across the University at the interface on machine
learning and the sciences, helping to share best practice and new
methods, and support each other in advancing their research. Over the
coming years, we’ll be running a variety of events and activities in
support of this.</li>
</ul>
<p>Progress so far includes: * Launched a Machine Learning Engineering
Clinic that has supported over 40 projects across the University with
MLE troubleshooting and advice; * Hosted and participated in events
reaching over 300 people; * Created a roadmap for the development of AI
in science, based on a Dagstuhl event that brought together 30
researchers from across the world.</p>

<p>The machine learning solutions we are dependent on to drive automated
decision making are dependent on data. But with regard to personal data
there are important issues of privacy. Data sharing brings benefits, but
also exposes our digital selves. From the use of social media data for
targeted advertising to influence us, to the use of genetic data to
identify criminals, or natural family members. Control of our virtual
selves maps on to control of our actual selves.</p>
<p>The feudal system that is implied by current data protection
legislation has significant power asymmetries at its heart, in that the
data controller has a duty of care over the data subject, but the data
subject may only discover failings in that duty of care when it’s too
late. Data controllers also may have conflicting motivations, and often
their primary motivation is <em>not</em> towards the data-subject, but
that is a consideration in their wider agenda.</p>
<p><a

Data Trusts</a> <span class="citation"
data-cites="Edwards:privacy04 Lawrence:trusts16 Delacroix:trusts18">(Delacroix
and Lawrence, 2018; Edwards, 2004; Lawrence, 2016)</span> are a
potential solution to this problem. Inspired by <em>land societies</em>
that formed in the 19th century to bring democratic representation to
the growing middle classes. A land society was a mutual organization
where resources were pooled for the common good.</p>
<p>A Personal Data Trust would be a legal entity where the trustees’
responsibility was entirely to the members of the trust. So the
motivation of the data-controllers is aligned only with the
data-subjects. How data is handled would be subject to the terms under
which the trust was convened. The success of an individual trust would
be contingent on it satisfying its members with appropriate balancing of
individual privacy with the benefits of data sharing.</p>
<p>Formation of Data Trusts became the number one recommendation of the
Hall-Presenti report on AI, but unfortunately, the term was confounded
with more general approaches to data sharing that don’t necessarily
involve fiduciary responsibilities or personal data rights. It seems
clear that we need to better characterize the data sharing landscape as
well as propose mechanisms for tackling specific issues in data
sharing.</p>
<p>It feels important to have a diversity of approaches, and yet it
feels important that any individual trust would be large enough to be
taken seriously in representing the views of its members in wider
negotiations.</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>
<p>Although the capabilities of new generative AIs are surprising
society, and being deployed more widely than previous waves of AI with
greater accessibility, many of the fundamental policy challenges of AI
haven’t changed. There is perhaps a greater urgency in the need for
solutions but the nature of the solutions needs to be responsive to the
impact of the technology we see. All the initiatives above exploit great
agility through building collaborations between social scientists,
humanities experts, technical experts and policy experts to give agile
advice to policy makers, domain experts and tech experts.</p>
