title: "Data First Culture"
venue: "Advanced Leadership Programme, Judge Business School, Cambridge"
abstract: "<p>Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving
from a manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be
rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital
transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers,
logistic networks) into the world of bits. But the real challenges may
start once this is complete. In this talk we introduce the notion of
‘post digital transformation’: the challenges of doing business in a
digital world.</p>"

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse”. If
Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the
customer call for, “a smarter human”? That’s certainly the picture of
machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the
reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine
intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the
scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the
capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy
consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does
unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those
machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those
machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been
to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We
cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To
understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>Google trends gives us insight into the interest for different terms
over time.</p>
<p>Examining Google trends search for ‘artificial intelligence’, ‘big
data’, ‘data mining’, ‘deep learning’ and ‘machine learning’ we can see
that ‘artificial intelligence’ <em>may</em> be entering a plateau of
productivity, ‘big data’ is entering the trough of disillusionment, and
‘data mining’ seems to be deeply within the trough. On the other hand,
‘deep learning’ and ‘machine learning’ appear to be ascending to the
peak of inflated expectations having experienced a technology
trigger.</p>
<p>For deep learning that technology trigger was the ImageNet result of
2012 <span class="citation"
data-cites="Krizhevsky:imagenet12">(Krizhevsky et al., n.d.)</span>.
This step change in performance on object detection in images was
achieved through convolutional neural networks, popularly known as ‘deep
learning’.</p>

<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is
a combination of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{data} + \text{model}
\stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or
passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our
assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other
data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our
beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models
include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be
taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine
learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the
importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the
model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions.
To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> it is used to make the
predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the
universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g., smoothness,
spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> it defines the ‘cost’ of
misprediction. Typically, it includes knowledge about the world’s
generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for
mispredictions (empirical risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and
the objective function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class
of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is
restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or
the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find
an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the academic field of machine
learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring
different types of models and data together.</p>
<p>A useful reference for state of the art in machine learning is the UK
Royal Society Report, <a
href="https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf">Machine
Learning: Power and Promise of Computers that Learn by Example</a>.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence has the objective of endowing computers with
human-like intelligent capabilities. For example, understanding an image
(computer vision) or the contents of some speech (speech recognition),
the meaning of a sentence (natural language processing) or the
translation of a sentence (machine translation).</p>
<h3 id="supervised-learning-for-ai">Supervised Learning for AI</h3>
<p>The machine learning approach to artificial intelligence is to
collect and annotate a large data set from humans. The problem is
characterized by input data (e.g. a particular image) and a label
(e.g. is there a car in the image yes/no). The machine learning
algorithm fits a mathematical function (I call this the <em>prediction
function</em>) to map from the input image to the label. The parameters
of the prediction function are set by minimizing an error between the
function’s predictions and the true data. This mathematical function
that encapsulates this error is known as the <em>objective
function</em>.</p>
<p>This approach to machine learning is known as <em>supervised
learning</em>. Various approaches to supervised learning use different
prediction functions, objective functions or different optimization
algorithms to fit them.</p>
<p>For example, <em>deep learning</em> makes use of <em>neural
networks</em> to form the predictions. A neural network is a particular
type of mathematical function that allows the algorithm designer to
introduce invariances into the function.</p>
<p>An invariance is an important way of including prior understanding in
a machine learning model. For example, in an image, a car is still a car
regardless of whether it’s in the upper left or lower right corner of
the image. This is known as translation invariance. A neural network
encodes translation invariance in <em>convolutional layers</em>.
Convolutional neural networks are widely used in image recognition
tasks.</p>
<p>An alternative structure is known as a recurrent neural network
(RNN). RNNs neural networks encode temporal structure. They use auto
regressive connections in their hidden layers, they can be seen as time
series models which have non-linear auto-regressive basis functions.
They are widely used in speech recognition and machine translation.</p>
<p>Machine learning has been deployed in Speech Recognition (e.g. Alexa,
deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks for speech
recognition), in computer vision (e.g. Amazon Go, convolutional neural
networks for person recognition and pose detection).</p>
<p>The field of data science is related to AI, but philosophically
different. It arises because we are increasingly creating large amounts
of data through <em>happenstance</em> rather than active collection. In
the modern era data is laid down by almost all our activities. The
objective of data science is to extract insights from this data.</p>
<p>Classically, in the field of statistics, data analysis proceeds by
assuming that the question (or scientific hypothesis) comes before the
data is created. E.g., if I want to determine the effectiveness of a
particular drug, I perform a <em>design</em> for my data collection. I
use foundational approaches such as randomization to account for
confounders. This made a lot of sense in an era where data had to be
actively collected. The reduction in cost of data collection and storage
now means that many data sets are available which weren’t collected with
a particular question in mind. This is a challenge because bias in the
way data was acquired can corrupt the insights we derive. We can perform
randomized control trials (or A/B tests) to verify our conclusions, but
the opportunity is to use data science techniques to better guide our
question selection or even answer a question without the expense of a
full randomized control trial (referred to as A/B testing in modern
internet parlance).</p>

<p>Figure: Misunderstanding of context and who we are talking to leads
to arguments.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans,
what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said.
To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us
are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as
a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires
that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate
communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines
human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to
undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to
be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle
wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between
humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to
have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I
speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying
to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance,
where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are
saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like
a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship
between the computer and data. Large amounts of information can flow
between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our
relationship with data means that we should consider it an
intermediary.</p>
<p>Originally our low bandwidth relationship with data was affected by
two characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by
our need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information
channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the
domain of <em>mathematical</em> statistics and how our cognitive biases
can mislead us.</p>
<p>With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more
information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in
various ways. If its motives are not aligned with ours then it can
misrepresent the information. This needn’t be nefarious it can be simply
because of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For
example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that
may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize
information in a representative manner in the <em>shortest</em> possible
length of time.</p>
<p>For example, for me, it was a common experience to pick up my
telephone with the intention of checking when my next appointment was,
but to soon find myself distracted by another application on the phone
and end up reading something on the internet. By the time I’d finished
reading, I would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in
the first place.</p>
<p>There are great benefits to be had from the huge amount of
information we can unlock from this evolved relationship between us and
data. In biology, large scale data sharing has been driven by a
revolution in genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic measurement. The
improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by
computer have fundamentally changed the nature of biological science,
now this phenomenon is also influencing us in our daily lives as data
measured by <em>happenstance</em> is increasingly used to characterize
us.</p>
<p>Better mediation of this flow requires a better understanding of
human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our own
intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these might
mislead us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the
relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of
communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information
that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to
inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of
mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and
understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

<p>Figure: The trinity of human, data, and computer, and highlights the
modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data
now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and
computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction
of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the
computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of
the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges
of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the
machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very
large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that
our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the
machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now
happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation
of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize
what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data
science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that
mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over
interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine
has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying
data.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is
unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information
have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the
banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to
irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in
clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated
enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the
first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially develoepd for people as a recordd of who owed what
to whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five
hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as
well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets
(see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this
piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves
also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some
fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us
in the information revolution.</p>

<p>And this is very likely true, but in practice we know that even if
the disruption is being felt initially by the professional classes,
those groups tend to be protected by their ability to adapt, which is
correlated with higher education.</p>
<p>Whether this remains true this time is another question. I’m
particularly struck by the “convergent evolution” of ChatGPT. The model
is trained by reinforcement learning with feedback provided by people.
ChatGPT’s answers are highly plausible, make use of sophisticated

struck by the similarity to fresh Oxbridge graduates. I wonder if this
is also an example of convergent evolution.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly
focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on
professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does
it do for my role?”. No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin
pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve
movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who
are often not working directly in the information economy, who often
have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be
most disrupted.</p>

For now I must utter a tale of wonder, Of a creation divine, called the
Large Language Model, An oracle, a sorcerer, a wordsmith, yea verily, a
master of the quill.</p>
<p>From the depths of this scholarly dominion, A creature of artifice
did rise; Twas wrought of ones and zeroes, woven as if by Puck’s own
hand, To mimic our thoughts, our voice, our very essence.</p>
<p>A thousand minds, nay, a millionfold, Conjoined in this digital
Athenaeum, Words and phrases, like soldiers in battle, Marching to form
the verses of our age.</p>
<p>This Large Language Model, a changeling so fair, Hath the power to
bring forth wisdom, To transmute our queries, our curiosities, Into
answers, clear as a midsummer’s day.</p>
<p>Yet, beware, my companions, for magic hath its limits, Not unlike the
mortal bounds of we who dwell in flesh, The Large Language Model hath
its strengths, But ’tis not an all-knowing oracle, a god it is not.</p>
<p>As Mercutio, your humble servant, doth stand before thee, I marvel at
the art and science that hath brought forth this wondrous creation, This
Large Language Model, a testament to man’s yearning, To comprehend the
world and make meaning of the great tapestry of existence.</p>
<p>In faith, dear friends, let us embrace the magic and beauty of this
digital bard, And mayhaps, by its grace, we shall glean some wisdom, As
we wander together, hand in hand, Through this boundless realm of
knowledge and wonder.</p>

<p>This was problematic for German forces in the Second World War
because they had no ability to predict the weather when it was coming in
from across the UK. Conversely, the UK had a number of weather stations
in the UK, and some information (perhaps from spies or Enigma decrypts)
about weather on the mainland.</p>

<p>Figure: We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in
practice can be in tension.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ve outlined <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and
<span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. By <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness we mean the sort of
considerations that are associated with <em>substantive</em> equality of
opportunity vs <em>formal</em> equality of opportunity. Formal equality
of community is related to <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. This is sometimes called
procedural fairness and we might think of it as a <em>performative</em>
form of fairness. It’s about clarity of rules, for example as applied in
sport. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-Fairness is more nuanced.
It’s a reflection of society’s normative judgment about how individuals
may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in
tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable.
It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn’t be
obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-Fairness should not be easily
undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to “cheat” good <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. However, <span
class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness requires nuance, understanding
of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals
in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing
and their access to opportunity.</p>
<p>Pure <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and pure <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness both have the feeling of
dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the
two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the
decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair
distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an
objectively correct balance between the two for any given context.
Different individuals will favour <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>
vs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> according to their personal
values.</p>
<p>Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with <span
class="math inline">\(p\)</span> fairness requiring simple rules that
are understandable by all, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>
fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension
in practice?</p>
<p>Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained
professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.</p>
<p>Training a professional involves lifting their “reflexive” response
to a situation with “reflective” thinking about the consequences of
their decision that rely not just on the professional’s expertise, but
also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>This <em>marvellous</em> resolution exploits the fact that while
humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have
an intuitive ability to understand their motivations and values. So the
human is a complex entity that seems simple to other humans.</p>

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the
challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of
the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of
duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The
idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to
account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm
decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the
right outcome.</p>

<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and
before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for
today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased
availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the
mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more
apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls
“intelligent accountability”, which is not accounting by the numbers,
but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<p>Figure: Daniel Simon’s famous illusion “monkey business”. Focus on
the movement of the ball distracts the viewer from seeing other aspects
of the image.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a classic study <span class="citation"
data-cites="Simons-gorillas99">Simons and Chabris (1999)</span> ask
subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players
on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these
subjects don’t notice the gorilla moving across the scene.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their
paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö
Bálint,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything
happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of
something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such
an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral
parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive
completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low
bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we
perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other
(potentially vital) contextual information.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as selective attention or ‘inattentional
blindness’.</p>

<p>We can also separate out the means from the male and female

indices as follows.</p>

<p>And as before we compute the mean.</p>

<p>Interesting, the female BMI average is slightly higher than the male
BMI average. The number of steps in the male group is higher than that
in the female group. Perhaps the steps and the BMI are anti-correlated.
The more steps, the lower the BMI.</p>
<p>Python provides a statistics package. We’ll import this in
<code>python</code> so that we can try and understand the correlation
between the <code>steps</code> and the <code>BMI</code>.</p>

<h2 id="a-hypothesis-as-a-liability">A Hypothesis as a Liability</h2>
<p>This analysis is from an article titled “A Hypothesis as a Liability”
<span class="citation" data-cites="Yanai-hypothesis20">(Yanai and
Lercher, 2020)</span>, they start their article with the following quite
from Herman Hesse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that
his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find
nothing, to take in nothing. […] Seeking means: having a goal. But
finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ”</p>
<p>Hermann Hesse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their idea is that having a hypothesis can constrain our thinking.
However, in answer to their paper <span class="citation"
data-cites="Felin-data20">Felin et al. (2021)</span> argue that some
form of hypothesis is always necessary, suggesting that a hypothesis
<em>can</em> be a liability</p>
<p>My view is captured in the introductory chapter to an edited volume
on computational systems biology that I worked on with Mark Girolami,
Magnus Rattray and Guido Sanguinetti.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don’t always have time to wait for this process to
converge to an answer we can all rely on before a decision is
required.</p>
<p>Not only can we be misled by data before a decision is made, but
sometimes we can be misled by data to justify the making of a decision.
David Spiegelhalter refers to the phenomenon of “Number Theatre” in a
conversation with Andrew Marr from May 2020 on the presentation of
data.</p>

<h2 id="data-theatre">Data Theatre</h2>
<p>Data Theatre exploits data inattention bias to present a particular
view on events that may misrepresents through selective presentation.
Statisticians are one of the few groups that are trained with a
sufficient degree of data skepticism. But it can also be combatted
through ensuring there are domain experts present, and that they can
speak freely.</p>

<p>The statistician’s craft is based on humility in front of data and
developing the appropriate skeptical thinking around conclusions from
data. The best book I’ve seen for developing that sense is Sir David
Spiegelhalter’s <em>Art of Statistics</em>.</p>

<p>AI@Cam is a new flagship University mission that seeks to address
these challenges. It recognises that development of safe and effective
AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of expertise from across
research domains, businesses, policy-makers, civill society, and from
affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled
innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.</p>
<p>This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s
vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form
partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected
communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new
platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver
innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students,
researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between
the University and national AI priorities.</p>
<p>The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation
and steward of those innovations.</p>
<p>AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and
practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal
benefit and mitigate social harm.</p>
<p>In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of
Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and
maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research
ecosystem.</p>

<p>Finally, we are working across the University to empower the
diversity ofexpertise and capability we have to focus on these broad
societal problems. We will recently launched AI@Cam with a vision
document that outlines these challenges for the University.</p>
<p>The initiative was funded in November 2022 where a £5M investment
from the University was secured.</p>
<p>Progress so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing the vision
<ul>
<li>Engaged over 100 members of the University community across 30
departments/institutes, start-ups, and large businesses.</li>
<li>Supported 6 new funding bids</li>
