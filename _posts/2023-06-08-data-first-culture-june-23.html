title: "Data First Culture"
venue: "Advanced Leadership Programme, Judge Business School, Cambridge"
abstract: "<p>Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving from a manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers, logistic networks) into the world of bits. But the real challenges may start once this is complete. In this talk we introduce the notion of ‘post digital transformation’: the challenges of doing business in a digital world.</p>"

<p>It’s said that Henry Ford’s customers wanted a “a faster horse.” If Henry Ford was selling us artificial intelligence today, what would the customer call for, “a smarter human?” That’s certainly the picture of machine intelligence we find in science fiction narratives, but the reality of what we’ve developed is much more mundane.</p>
<p>Car engines produce prodigious power from petrol. Machine intelligences deliver decisions derived from data. In both cases the scale of consumption enables a speed of operation that is far beyond the capabilities of their natural counterparts. Unfettered energy consumption has consequences in the form of climate change. Does unbridled data consumption also have consequences for us?</p>
<p>If we devolve decision making to machines, we depend on those machines to accommodate our needs. If we don’t understand how those machines operate, we lose control over our destiny. Our mistake has been to see machine intelligence as a reflection of our intelligence. We cannot understand the smarter human without understanding the human. To understand the machine, we need to better understand ourselves.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Gartner Hype Cycle</a> tries to assess where an idea is in terms of maturity and adoption. It splits the evolution of technology into a technological trigger, a peak of expectations followed by a trough of disillusionment and a final ascension into a useful technology. It looks rather like a classical control response to a final set point.</p>

<p>Google trends gives us insight into the interest for different terms over time.</p>
<p>Examining Google trends search for ‘artificial intelligence,’ ‘big data,’ ‘data mining,’ ‘deep learning’ and ‘machine learning’ we can see that ‘artificial intelligence’ <em>may</em> be entering a plateau of productivity, ‘big data’ is entering the trough of disillusionment, and ‘data mining’ seems to be deeply within the trough. On the other hand, ‘deep learning’ and ‘machine learning’ appear to be ascending to the peak of inflated expectations having experienced a technology trigger.</p>
<p>For deep learning that technology trigger was the ImageNet result of 2012 <span class="citation" data-cites="Krizhevsky:imagenet12">(Krizhevsky et al., n.d.)</span>. This step change in performance on object detection in images was achieved through convolutional neural networks, popularly known as ‘deep learning.’</p>

<p>What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a combination of</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\]</span></p>
<p>where <em>data</em> is our observations. They can be actively or passively acquired (meta-data). The <em>model</em> contains our assumptions, based on previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come from transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive biases. The <em>prediction</em> is an action to be taken or a categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through computation.</p>
<p>In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To combine data with a model we typically make use of:</p>
<p><strong>a prediction function</strong> it is used to make the predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g., smoothness, spatial similarities, temporal similarities.</p>
<p><strong>an objective function</strong> it defines the ‘cost’ of misprediction. Typically, it includes knowledge about the world’s generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for mispredictions (empirical risk minimization).</p>
<p>The combination of data and model through the prediction function and the objective function leads to a <em>learning algorithm</em>. The class of prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the academic field of machine learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring different types of models and data together.</p>
<p>A useful reference for state of the art in machine learning is the UK Royal Society Report, <a href="https://royalsociety.org/~/media/policy/projects/machine-learning/publications/machine-learning-report.pdf">Machine Learning: Power and Promise of Computers that Learn by Example</a>.</p>

<p>Artificial intelligence has the objective of endowing computers with human-like intelligent capabilities. For example, understanding an image (computer vision) or the contents of some speech (speech recognition), the meaning of a sentence (natural language processing) or the translation of a sentence (machine translation).</p>
<h3 id="supervised-learning-for-ai">Supervised Learning for AI</h3>
<p>The machine learning approach to artificial intelligence is to collect and annotate a large data set from humans. The problem is characterized by input data (e.g. a particular image) and a label (e.g. is there a car in the image yes/no). The machine learning algorithm fits a mathematical function (I call this the <em>prediction function</em>) to map from the input image to the label. The parameters of the prediction function are set by minimizing an error between the function’s predictions and the true data. This mathematical function that encapsulates this error is known as the <em>objective function</em>.</p>
<p>This approach to machine learning is known as <em>supervised learning</em>. Various approaches to supervised learning use different prediction functions, objective functions or different optimization algorithms to fit them.</p>
<p>For example, <em>deep learning</em> makes use of <em>neural networks</em> to form the predictions. A neural network is a particular type of mathematical function that allows the algorithm designer to introduce invariances into the function.</p>
<p>An invariance is an important way of including prior understanding in a machine learning model. For example, in an image, a car is still a car regardless of whether it’s in the upper left or lower right corner of the image. This is known as translation invariance. A neural network encodes translation invariance in <em>convolutional layers</em>. Convolutional neural networks are widely used in image recognition tasks.</p>
<p>An alternative structure is known as a recurrent neural network (RNN). RNNs neural networks encode temporal structure. They use auto regressive connections in their hidden layers, they can be seen as time series models which have non-linear auto-regressive basis functions. They are widely used in speech recognition and machine translation.</p>
<p>Machine learning has been deployed in Speech Recognition (e.g. Alexa, deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks for speech recognition), in computer vision (e.g. Amazon Go, convolutional neural networks for person recognition and pose detection).</p>
<p>The field of data science is related to AI, but philosophically different. It arises because we are increasingly creating large amounts of data through <em>happenstance</em> rather than active collection. In the modern era data is laid down by almost all our activities. The objective of data science is to extract insights from this data.</p>
<p>Classically, in the field of statistics, data analysis proceeds by assuming that the question (or scientific hypothesis) comes before the data is created. E.g., if I want to determine the effectiveness of a particular drug, I perform a <em>design</em> for my data collection. I use foundational approaches such as randomization to account for confounders. This made a lot of sense in an era where data had to be actively collected. The reduction in cost of data collection and storage now means that many data sets are available which weren’t collected with a particular question in mind. This is a challenge because bias in the way data was acquired can corrupt the insights we derive. We can perform randomized control trials (or A/B tests) to verify our conclusions, but the opportunity is to use data science techniques to better guide our question selection or even answer a question without the expense of a full randomized control trial (referred to as A/B testing in modern internet parlance).</p>

<p>Figure: Consider the six-word novel, apocryphally credited to Ernest Hemingway, “For sale: baby shoes, never worn.” To understand what that means to a human, you need a great deal of additional context. Context that is not directly accessible to a machine that has not got both the evolved and contextual understanding of our own condition to realize both the implication of the advert and what that implication means emotionally to the previous owner.</p>

<p>But this is a very different kind of intelligence than ours. A computer cannot understand the depth of the Ernest Hemingway’s apocryphal six-word novel: “For Sale, Baby Shoes, Never worn,” because it isn’t equipped with that ability to model the complexity of humanity that underlies that statement.</p>

<p>Embodiment factors imply that, in our communication between humans, what is <em>not</em> said is, perhaps, more important than what is said. To communicate with each other we need to have a model of who each of us are.</p>
<p>To aid this, in society, we are required to perform roles. Whether as a parent, a teacher, an employee or a boss. Each of these roles requires that we conform to certain standards of behaviour to facilitate communication between ourselves.</p>
<p>Control of self is vitally important to these communications.</p>
<p>The high availability of data available to humans undermines human-to-human communication channels by providing new routes to undermining our control of self.</p>
<p>The consequences between this mismatch of power and delivery are to be seen all around us. Because, just as driving an F1 car with bicycle wheels would be a fine art, so is the process of communication between humans.</p>
<p>If I have a thought and I wish to communicate it, I first need to have a model of what you think. I should think before I speak. When I speak, you may react. You have a model of who I am and what I was trying to say, and why I chose to say what I said. Now we begin this dance, where we are each trying to better understand each other and what we are saying. When it works, it is beautiful, but when mis-deployed, just like a badly driven F1 car, there is a horrible crash, an argument.</p>

<p>The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship between the computer and data. Large amounts of information can flow between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our relationship with data means that we should consider it an intermediary.</p>
<p>Originally our low bandwidth relationship with data was affected by two characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by our need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the domain of <em>mathematical</em> statistics and how our cognitive biases can mislead us.</p>
<p>With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in various ways. If its motives are not aligned with ours then it can misrepresent the information. This needn’t be nefarious it can be simply because of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize information in a representative manner in the <em>shortest</em> possible length of time.</p>
<p>For example, for me, it was a common experience to pick up my telephone with the intention of checking when my next appointment was, but to soon find myself distracted by another application on the phone and end up reading something on the internet. By the time I’d finished reading, I would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in the first place.</p>
<p>There are great benefits to be had from the huge amount of information we can unlock from this evolved relationship between us and data. In biology, large scale data sharing has been driven by a revolution in genomic, transcriptomic and epigenomic measurement. The improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by computer have fundamentally changed the nature of biological science, now this phenomenon is also influencing us in our daily lives as data measured by <em>happenstance</em> is increasingly used to characterize us.</p>
<p>Better mediation of this flow requires a better understanding of human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our own intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these might mislead us.</p>

<p>Classically the field of statistics focused on mediating the relationship between the machine and the human. Our limited bandwidth of communication means we tend to over-interpret the limited information that we are given, in the extreme we assign motives and desires to inanimate objects (a process known as anthropomorphizing). Much of mathematical statistics was developed to help temper this tendency and understand when we are valid in drawing conclusions from data.</p>

<p>Figure: The trinity of human, data, and computer, and highlights the modern phenomenon. The communication channel between computer and data now has an extremely high bandwidth. The channel between human and computer and the channel between data and human is narrow. New direction of information flow, information is reaching us mediated by the computer. The focus on classical statistics reflected the importance of the direct communication between human and data. The modern challenges of data science emerge when that relationship is being mediated by the machine.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Data science brings new challenges. In particular, there is a very large bandwidth connection between the machine and data. This means that our relationship with data is now commonly being mediated by the machine. Whether this is in the acquisition of new data, which now happens by happenstance rather than with purpose, or the interpretation of that data where we are increasingly relying on machines to summarize what the data contains. This is leading to the emerging field of data science, which must not only deal with the same challenges that mathematical statistics faced in tempering our tendency to over interpret data but must also deal with the possibility that the machine has either inadvertently or maliciously misrepresented the underlying data.</p>

<p>Arguably the information revolution we are experiencing is unprecedented in history. But changes in the way we share information have a long history. Over 5,000 years ago in the city of Uruk, on the banks of the Euphrates, communities which relied on the water to irrigate their corps developed an approach to recording transactions in clay. Eventually the system of recording system became sophisticated enough that their oral histories could be recorded in the form of the first epic: Gilgamesh.</p>

<p>It was initially develoepd for people as a recordd of who owed what to whom, expanding individuals’ capacity to remember. But over a five hundred year period writing evolved to become a tool for literature as well. More pithily put, writing was invented by accountants not poets (see e.g. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39870485">this piece by Tim Harford</a>).</p>
<p>In some respects today’s revolution is different, because it involves also the creation of stories as well as their curation. But in some fundamental ways we can see what we have produced as another tool for us in the information revolution.</p>

<p>And this is very likely true, but in practice we know that even if the disruption is being felt initially by the professional classes, those groups tend to be protected by their ability to adapt, which is correlated with higher education.</p>
<p>Whether this remains true this time is another question. I’m particularly struck by the “convergent evolution” of ChatGPT. The model is trained by reinforcement learning with feedback provided by people. ChatGPT’s answers are highly plausible, make use of sophisticated language in an intelligent sounding way and are often incorrect. I’m struck by the similarity to fresh Oxbridge graduates. I wonder if this is also an example of convergent evolution.</p>

<p>One danger of the current hype around ChatGPT is that we are overly focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question “what does it do for my role?” No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who are often not working directly in the information economy, who often have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be most disrupted.</p>

<p>This was problematic for German forces in the Second World War because they had no ability to predict the weather when it was coming in from across the UK.

<p>Figure: We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in practice can be in tension.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>We’ve outlined <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. By <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness we mean the sort of considerations that are associated with <em>substantive</em> equality of opportunity vs <em>formal</em> equality of opportunity. Formal equality of community is related to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. This is sometimes called procedural fairness and we might think of it as a <em>performative</em> form of fairness. It’s about clarity of rules, for example as applied in sport. <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-Fairness is more nuanced. It’s a reflection of society’s normative judgment about how individuals may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.</p>
<p>The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable. It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn’t be obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-Fairness should not be easily undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to “cheat” good <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness. However, <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness requires nuance, understanding of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing and their access to opportunity.</p>
<p>Pure <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-fairness and pure <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>-fairness both have the feeling of dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an objectively correct balance between the two for any given context. Different individuals will favour <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> vs <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> according to their personal values.</p>
<p>Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> fairness requiring simple rules that are understandable by all, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension in practice?</p>
<p>Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.</p>
<p>Training a professional involves lifting their “reflexive” response to a situation with “reflective” thinking about the consequences of their decision that rely not just on the professional’s expertise, but also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.</p>
<p>This <em>marvellous</em> resolution exploits the fact that while humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have an intuitive ability to understand their motivations and values. So the human is a complex entity that seems simple to other humans.</p>

<p>In Baroness Onora O’Neill’s Reeith Lectures from 2002, she raises the challenge of trust. There are many aspects to her arcuments, but one of the key points she makes is that we cannot trust without the notion of duty. O’Neill is bemoaning the substitution of duty with process. The idea is that processes and transparency are supposed to hold us to account by measuring outcomes. But these processes themselves overwhelm decision makers and undermine their professional duty to deliver the right outcome.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill is speaking in 2002, in the early days of the internet and before social media. Much of her thoughts are even more relevant for today than they were when she spoke. This is because the increased availability of information and machine driven decision-making makes the mistaken premise, that process is an adequate substitute for duty, more apparently plausible. But this undermines what O’Neill calls “intelligent accountability,” which is not accounting by the numbers, but through professional education and institutional safeguards.</p>

<p>Figure: Daniel Simon’s famous illusion “monkey business.” Focus on the movement of the ball distracts the viewer from seeing other aspects of the image.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a classic study <span class="citation" data-cites="Simons-gorillas99">Simons and Chabris (1999)</span> ask subjects to count the number of passes of the basketball between players on the team wearing white shirts. Fifty percent of the time, these subjects don’t notice the gorilla moving across the scene.</p>
<p>The phenomenon of inattentional blindness is well known, e.g in their paper Simons and Charbris quote the Hungarian neurologist, Rezsö Bálint,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a well-known phenomenon that we do not notice anything happening in our surroundings while being absorbed in the inspection of something; focusing our attention on a certain object may happen to such an extent that we cannot perceive other objects placed in the peripheral parts of our visual field, although the light rays they emit arrive completely at the visual sphere of the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p>Rezsö Bálint 1907 (translated in Husain and Stein 1988, page 91)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When we combine the complexity of the world with our relatively low bandwidth for information, problems can arise. Our focus on what we perceive to be the most important problem can cause us to miss other (potentially vital) contextual information.</p>
<p>This phenomenon is known as selective attention or ‘inattentional blindness.’</p>

<p>It is good practice to give our variables interpretable names so that the analysis may be clearly understood by others.

<p>We can also separate out the means from the male and female populations. In python this can be done by setting male and female indices as follows.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb13"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb13-1"><a href="#cb13-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_ind <span class="op">=</span> (gender<span class="op">==</span><span class="dv">0</span>)</span>

<p>And now we can extract the variables for the two populations.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb14"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb14-1"><a href="#cb14-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_steps <span class="op">=</span> steps[male_ind]</span>
<span id="cb14-2"><a href="#cb14-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>male_bmi <span class="op">=</span> bmi[male_ind]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And as before we compute the mean.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb15"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span id="cb15-1"><a href="#cb15-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="bu">print</span>(<span class="st">&#39;Male steps mean is </span><span class="sc">{mean}</span><span class="st">.&#39;</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(mean<span class="op">=</span>male_steps.mean()))</span></code></pre></div>

<p>Similarly, we can get the same result for the female portion of the populaton.</p>

<p>Interesting, the female BMI average is slightly higher than the male BMI average. The number of steps in the male group is higher than that in the female group. Perhaps the steps and the BMI are anti-correlated. The more steps, the lower the BMI.</p>
<p>Python provides a statistics package. We’ll import this in <code>python</code> so that we can try and understand the correlation between the <code>steps</code> and the <code>BMI</code>.</p>

<h2 id="a-hypothesis-as-a-liability">A Hypothesis as a Liability</h2>
<p>This analysis is from an article titled “A Hypothesis as a Liability” <span class="citation" data-cites="Yanai-hypothesis20">(Yanai and Lercher, 2020)</span>, they start their article with the following quite from Herman Hesse.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing. […] Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ”</p>
<p>Hermann Hesse</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their idea is that having a hypothesis can constrain our thinking. However, in answer to their paper <span class="citation" data-cites="Felin-data20">Felin et al. (2021)</span> argue that some form of hypothesis is always necessary, suggesting that a hypothesis <em>can</em> be a liability</p>
<p>My view is captured in the introductory chapter to an edited volume on computational systems biology that I worked on with Mark Girolami, Magnus Rattray and Guido Sanguinetti.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don’t always have time to wait for this process to converge to an answer we can all rely on before a decision is required.</p>
<p>Not only can we be misled by data before a decision is made, but sometimes we can be misled by data to justify the making of a decision. David Spiegelhalter refers to the phenomenon of “Number Theatre” in a conversation with Andrew Marr from May 2020 on the presentation of data.</p>

<p>The best book I have found for teaching the skeptical sense of data that underlies the statistician’s craft is David Spiegelhalter’s <em>Art of Statistics</em>.</p>

</div>
<p>David’s book <span class="citation" data-cites="Spiegelhalter-art19">(Spiegelhalter, 2019)</span> brings important examples from statistics to life in an intelligent and entertaining way. It is highly readable and gives an opportunity to fast-track towards the important skill of data-skepticism that is the mark of a professional statistician.</p>

<p>AI@Cam is a new flagship University mission that seeks to address these challenges. It recognises that development of safe and effective AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of expertise from across research domains, businesses, policy-makers, civill society, and from affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.</p>
<p>This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between the University and national AI priorities.</p>
<p>The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and steward of those innovations.</p>
<p>AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal benefit and mitigate social harm.</p>
<p>In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research ecosystem.</p>

<p>Finally, we are working across the University to empower the diversity ofexpertise and capability we have to focus on these broad societal problems. We will recently launched AI@Cam with a vision document that outlines these challenges for the University.</p>
<p>The initiative was funded in November 2022 where a £5M investment from the University was secured.</p>
<p>Progress so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing the vision
<ul>
<li>Engaged over 100 members of the University community across 30 departments/institutes, start-ups, and large businesses.</li>
<li>Supported 6 new funding bids</li>
