\notes{So what's going on here? One analogy I like to use is with weather forecasting. Historically, before the use of computer driven weather forecasting, we used a process of interpolation to measure the pressure.}

\notes{This was problematic for German forces in the Second World War because they had no ability to predict the weather when it was coming in from across the UK. Conversely, the UK had a number of weather stations in the UK, and some information (perhaps from spies or Enigma decrypts) about weather on the mainland.}

(detail from <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/library-and-archive/archive-hidden-treasures/d-day>). Note the lack of measurements within the UK. THis is the direction that weather was coming from so the locaiton of weather fronts (and associated storms) was harder for the Deutscher Wetterdienst to predict than the Met Office.}{dwd-weather}

\notes{This meant that more accurate forecasts were possible for D-Day for the Allies than for the defending forces. As a result, on the morning that Eisenhower invated, Rommel was back in Germany attending his wife's 50th birthday party.}
