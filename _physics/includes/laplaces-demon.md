\notes{One way of viewing what Laplace is saying is that we can take "the forces by which nature is animated" or our best mathematical/computational abstraction of that which we would call the *model* and combine it with the "respective situation of the beings who compose it" which I would refer to as the *data* and if we have an "intelligence sufficiently vast enough to submit these data to analysis", or sufficient *compute* then we would have a system for which "nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present in its eyes", or in other words we can make a *prediction*. Or more succinctly put we have}

\aligncenter{
$$
\text{model} + \text{data} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}\notes{.}$$}

\notes{Laplace's demon has been a recurring theme in science, we can also find it in Stephen Hawking's book *A Brief History of Time* [@Hawking-history88].}

\notes{But is it really that simple? Do we just need more and more accurate models and more and more data?}
