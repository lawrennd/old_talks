\subsection{Hydrodynamica}

\notes{When Laplace spoke of the curve of a simple molecule of air, he may well have been thinking of Daniel Bernoulli (1700-1782). Daniel Bernoulli was one name in a prodigious family. His father and brother were both mathematicians. Daniel's main work was known as *Hydrodynamica*.}

\notes{Daniel Bernoulli described a kinetic theory of gases, but it wasn't until 170 years later when these ideas were verified after Einstein had proposed a model of Brownian motion which was experimentally verified by Jean Baptiste Perrin.}

\figure{\includegooglebook{3yRVAAAAcAAJ}{PA200}}{Daniel Bernoulli's chapter on 
the kinetic theory of gases, for a review on the context of this chapter see @Mikhailov:hydrodynamica05. For 1738 this is extraordinary thinking. The notion of kinetic theory of gases wouldn't become fully accepted in Physics until 1908 when a model of Einstein's was verified by Jean Baptiste Perrin.}
