\notes{Famously, Laplace considered the idea of a deterministic Universe, one in which the model is *known*, or as the below translation refers to it, "an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated". He speculates on an "intelligence" that can submit this vast data to analysis and propsoses that such an entity would be able to predict the future.

>Given for one instant an intelligence which could comprehend all the forces by which nature is animated and the respective situation of the beings who compose it---an intelligence sufficiently vast to submit these data to analysis---it would embrace in the same formulate the movements of the greatest bodies of the universe and those of the lightest atom; for it, nothing would be uncertain and the future, as the past, would be present in its eyes.}

\notes{This notion is known as *Laplace's demon* or *Laplace's superman*.}

\notes{Unfortunately, most analyses of his ideas stop at that point, whereas his real point is that such a notion is unreachable. Not so much *superman* as *strawman*. Just three pages later in the "Philosophical Essay on Probabilities" [@Laplace:essai14], Laplace goes on to observe:

> The curve described by a simple molecule of air or vapor is regulated in a manner just as certain as the planetary orbits; the only difference between them is that which comes from our ignorance.
>
> Probability is relative, in part to this ignorance, in part to our knowledge.}

\notes{In other words, we can never make use of the idealistic deterministic Universe due to our ignorance about the world, Laplace's suggestion, and focus in this essay is that we turn to probability to deal with this uncertainty. This is also our inspiration for using probability in machine learning. 

The "forces by which nature is animated" is our *model*, the "situation of beings that compose it" is our *data* and the "intelligence sufficiently vast enough to submit these data to analysis" is our compute. The fly in the ointment is our *ignorance* about these aspects. And *probability* is the tool we use to incorporate this ignorance leading to uncertainty or *doubt* in our predictions.}
