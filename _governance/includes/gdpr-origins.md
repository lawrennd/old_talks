\subsection{GDPR Origins}

\notes{There's been much recent talk about GDPR, much of it implying that the recent incarnation is radically different from previous incarnations. While the most recent iteration began to be developed in 2012, but in reality, its origins are much older. [It dates back to 1981](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_for_the_protection_of_individuals_with_regard_to_automatic_processing_of_personal_data), and [28th January is "Data Potection day"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Privacy_Day). The essence of the law didn't change much in the previous iterations. The critical chance was the size of the fines that the EU stipulated may be imposed for infringements. Paul Nemitz, who was closely involved with the drafting, told me that they were initially inspired by competition law, which levies fines of 10% of international revenue. The final implementation is restricted to 5%, but it's worth pointing out that Facebook's fine (imposed in the US by the FTC) was $5 billion dollars. Or approximately 7% of their international revenue at the time. 

So the big change is the seriousness with which regulators are taking breaches of the intent of GDPR. And indeed, this newfound will on behalf of the EU led to an amount of panic around companies who rushed to see if they were complying with this strengthened legislation.

But is it really the big bad regulator coming down hard on the poor scientist or company, just trying to do an honest day's work? I would argue not. The stipulations of the GDPR include fairly simple things like the 'right to an explanation' for consequential decision-making. Or the right to deletion, to remove personal private data from a corporate data ecosystem.

While these are new stipulations, if you reverse the argument and ask a company "would it not be a good thing if you could explain why your automated decision making system is making decision X about customer Y" seems perfectly reasonable. Or "Would it not be a good thing if we knew that we were capable of deleting customer Z's data from our systems, rather than being concerned that it may be lying unregistered in an S3 bucket somewhere?". 

Phrased in this way, you can see that GDPR perhaps would better stand for "Good Data Practice Rules", and should really be being adopted by the scientist, the company or whoever in an effort to respect the rights of the people they aim to serve.

So how do Data Trusts fit into this landscape? Well it's appropriate that we've mentioned the commons, because a current challenge is how we manage data rights within our community. And the situation is rather akin to that which one might have found in a feudal village (in the days before Houndkirk Moor was enclosed).}
