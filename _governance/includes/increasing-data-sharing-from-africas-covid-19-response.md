\notes{\subsection{Morine's Areas for Action}}

\notes{Building capacity of organisations in the public and private sector to reuse and act on data through investments in training, education, and reskilling of relevant authorities;

Establishing data stewards in organisations who can coordinate and collaborate with counterparts on using data in the public’s interest and acting on it.

Technical skills and expertise-researchers (eg data scientists) to develop and deploy useful, privacy-preserving technologies.

Developing but also clarifying governance framework to enable the trusted, transparent, and accountable reuse of privately held data in the public interest under a clear regulatory framework

Data Collaboratives are a new form of collaboration, beyond the public-private partnership model, in which participants from different sectors — in particular companies -  exchange their data to create public value.}
