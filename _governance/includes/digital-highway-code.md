\notes{So how do we regulate for such an eventuality? I'm fond of a quote from Rodney Brooks that says: "You can't regulate what doesn't exist". Indeed, it seems we have enough problems with regulating technologies and ideas that already exist today. But again, we can be inspired by the way that regulation has evolved in the past to take into account evolving technology. In particular, in intellectual property, patents emerged from the notion of 'letters patent', which were monopolies granted by the monarch for a guild to work in a certain domain, such as weaving. They have evolved to be a mechanism for intellectual property rights.

Similarly, when motorised vehicles were introduced, after some false starts (including the poorly formed Red Flag Act) a Highway Code emerged that lays out the different responsibilities of road users in sharing the highway.}
