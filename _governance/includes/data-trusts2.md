\subsection{Personal Data Trusts}

\notes{What mechanism should we look to for forming these 'data collectives'. There are many inspirations from history including credit unions, building societies, co-operatives and land societies. Many of these have the bottom-up flavour of a collective that feels appropriate for managing data rights. 

One particularly interesting mechanism also dates back to Medieval law. The Courts of Equity is a separate system of law that runs alongside Common Law. One of the domains of law it recognises are Trusts.

Trusts are institutions where there is an enhanced duty of care, known as "fiducirary duty" or "undivided loyalty" over the trustees to implement the constituent terms of the trust. 

Broadly speaking a Trust has three components. There are the settlors. This group is the group that starts with assets. These might be rights to the property, or in the data trust, the rights to data. Then there are the beneficiaries. This is the group that will benefit from the operation of the trust. Finally there are the Trustees. This group oversees the management of the trust and ensures that the settlors intent is being conformed to in the management of the assets.

In a Data Trust [@Delacroix:trusts19] the settlors and the beneficiaries will be the same, or significantly overlapping groups. Unusually, because the value of data only comes when it accumulates, it is only once the data is within the Trust that it becomes useful. In the data trust, the Trustee takes on the role of data-controller. But they are now obliged to conform to the constitutional terms of the trust that is formed.

The data trust is not a specfic solution for data sharing. It is a set of legal mechanisms that can be used to create solutions. The consitutional terms of the trust will depend on what data is being shared and for what purpose. One can imagine data trusts that are associated with special interests, like a group of patients with a particular cancer. Or data trusts that might be associated with a region (the Hackney Data Trust) for assisting with local issues like transport links etc. Or one could imagine general data trusts, that would interact with individual specialized data trusts.}

\notes{Importantly, any data governance approach is going to have tensions. In particular, there is a need to represent the interests of the *individual*, the interests of *society* and those of *vulnerable people* (such as children). Any data constitutional terms should also consider issues such as *enfranchisement* of the data subjects. There is a [value based choice for how particular data should be shared](https://datatrusts.uk/blogs/selectingdatastructures).

But in order to enact such choices, and ensure that the correct responsibilities are applied to the data controllers, Trust law seems a promising avenue to pursue in institutionalising data sharing.}
