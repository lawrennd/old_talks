\subsection{Feudal Era Data Ecosystem}


\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/Medievalplowingwoodcut}{80%}}{Feudal systems consist of serfs and vassals who are under the protection of a Lord. The Lord has a duty of care over the vassals, but due to power asymmetries that duty of care can be difficult to monitor and enforce. This is similar to the way our information is managed. Data controllers have a duty of care towards their data subjects, but there is also a power asymmetry between controller and subject.}{feudal-data-system}

\notes{Our current information infrastructure bears a close relation with *feudal systems* of government. In the feudal system a lord had a duty of care over his serfs and vassals, a duty to protect subjects. But in practice there was a power-asymetry. In feudal days protection was against Viking raiders, today, it is against information raiders. However, when there is an information leak, when there is some failure in protections, it is already too late. 

Alternatively, our data is publicly shared, as in an information commons. Akin to common land of the medieval village. But just as commons were subject to overgrazing and poor management, so it is that much of our data cannot be managed in this way. In particularly personal, sensitive data. 

I explored this idea further in this \addguardian{2015/nov/16/information-barons-threaten-autonomy-privacy-online}{Information Barons}.}
