\subsection{Data Rights}

\notes{Data is not property, at least not in the modern sense of the word. But if we look back over time, we see different notions of property. In particular, associated with different resources. For example, common land is a particular type of property, which may or may not be explicitly owned, but members of a community have a particular set of rights to.

In Sheffield, where I used to live, work, run and cycle. The moorland was historically common land until the enclosures acts applied in the 1860s. Until that time, local people had the right to, for example, collect sand from the moorland for use in building their houses. After enclosure, the crime of 'sand poaching' evolved. On Houndkirk Moor, south West of Sheffield, after enclosure [sand poachers went to collect sand at night](https://slidelegend.com/from-cairns-to-craters-conservation-heritage-moors-for-the-future_59e1b4f91723dd4240b3158c.html) for houses being built in the village of Dore.}

\notes{Computational Biologists at the forefront of data sharing, particularly public data sharing. Transcriptomic, genomic, epigenomic data is publicly available and have allowed people, like me, not even working directly with biologists to develop algorithms for interpreting and analyzing that data.}

\notes{But as we transition from biological data to health data, that data starts to pertain to individuals. It falls under the domain of personal data.}

\notes{These rights to a resource become particularly interesting when considering rivers. Sheffield itself emerged as the home of cutlers, knife makers. Their small mills were driven by water-power flowing from Houndkirk Moor to the center of town. There the lakes they built are called dams, today they line the streams of the city's parkland, but 200 years ago they were a bustling industry of forges, grinders and polishers.

Important, regardless of who owned the river, different mills on the river had different rights to the water. If an upstream mill damns the entire flow, the downstream mill has to stop working in times of drought.

The rivers of Sheffield are streams, but as they flow down into the Don and eventually the Humber new rights to this water emerge. As well as power from the river, there is its use as a source of drinking water, for navigation and for irrigation.}

This Wheel is [now a working museum](http://www.simt.co.uk/shepherd-wheel-workshop) on Porter Brook, but it dates originally to the 1500s. It now sits in Bingham Park, but historically the river would have had several Wheels operating from the Porter Brook.}{shepherd-wheel}

\notes{Many of these rights are in tension. Mills working on the river may pollute the stream. If the water is damned or  used for irrigation, then it can be too low for navigation. There is complex interplay of demands on the river that creates tensions between different users.

The general data protection regulation is poorly named. It doesn't protect data, what it does instead is give us some limited rights around access to and control of processing of our personal data. 

Personal data has some of the characteristics of a river. My choice to share my data has effects on other individuals. If I share my genome, I am sharing information about my children's genome. If I share my address book (e.g. with Facebook or Linkedin) I'm sharing information about what people know me. If I share a photo of myself with friends, I'm sharing the location of friends. 

What the GDPR does is give us limited personal data rights. It outlines a limited right of deletion. It also allows us access to our personal data, which in turn confers a portability right.

A pure notion of ownership, in that I own a ball, or I own a car, is that I have the absolute right to share and restrict access to my property as I choose. Personal data rights are not absolute, but nevertheless they return some control to the individual.}
