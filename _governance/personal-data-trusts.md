title: "Personal Data Trusts"
abstract: >
  Computational oncologists know better than any other domain the importance of data sharing in progress in understanding complex decisions. Underlying the revolution in "artificial intelligence" is really a revolution in data. But when data is persona or has legal protections placed upon there are challenges to data sharing. In this talk we introduce the ideas behind data sharing and the model of data trusts, an approach to data sharing that relies on trust law to form its governance structure.
