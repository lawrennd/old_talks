\newslide{Nigeria NMIS Data: Notebook}

\notes{As an example data set we will use Nigerian Millennium Development Goals Information System Health Facility [@Nigeria-nmis14]. It can be found here <https://energydata.info/dataset/nigeria-nmis-education-facility-data-2014>.}

\notes{Taking from the information on the site, 

>The Nigeria MDG (Millennium Development Goals) Information System – NMIS health facility data is collected by the Office of the Senior Special Assistant to the President on the Millennium Development Goals (OSSAP-MDGs) in partner with the Sustainable Engineering Lab at Columbia University. A rigorous, geo-referenced baseline facility inventory across Nigeria is created spanning from 2009 to 2011 with an additional survey effort to increase coverage in 2014, to build Nigeria’s first nation-wide inventory of health facility. The database includes 34,139 health facilities info in Nigeria.
>
>The goal of this database is to make the data collected available to planners, government officials, and the public, to be used to make strategic decisions for planning relevant interventions.

\notes{For ease of use we've packaged this data set in the `pods` library}

\include{_software/includes/pods-software.md}

\code{data = pods.datasets.nigeria_nmis()['Y']
data.head()}

\notes{Alternatively, you can access the data directly with the following commands.

```{.python}
import urllib.request
urllib.request.urlretrieve('https://energydata.info/dataset/f85d1796-e7f2-4630-be84-79420174e3bd/resource/6e640a13-cab4-457b-b9e6-0336051bac27/download/healthmopupandbaselinenmisfacility.csv', 'healthmopupandbaselinenmisfacility.csv')

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('healthmopupandbaselinenmisfacility.csv')
```
}

\define{\nmisdatadownloaded}

\notes{Once it is loaded in the data can be summarized using the `describe` method in pandas.}

\code{data.describe()}

\notes{We can also find out the dimensions of the dataset using the `shape` property.}

\code{data.shape}

\notes{Dataframes have different functions that you can use to explore and understand your data. In python and the Jupyter notebook it is possible to see a list of all possible functions and attributes by typing the name of the object followed by `.<Tab>` for example in the above case if we type `data.<Tab>` it show the columns available (these are attributes in pandas dataframes) such as `num_nurses_fulltime`, and also functions, such as `.describe()`.}

\notes{For functions we can also see the documentation about the function by following the name with a question mark. This will open a box with documentation at the bottom which can be closed with the x button.}

\code{data.describe?}

\setupplotcode{import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import mlai
import mlai.plot as plot}

\plotcode{fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=plot.big_figsize)
ax.plot(data.longitude, data.latitude, 'ro', alpha=0.01)
ax.set_xlabel('longitude')
ax.set_ylabel('latitude')

mlai.write_figure('nigerian-health-facilities.png', directory='\writeDiagramsDir/ml')}
