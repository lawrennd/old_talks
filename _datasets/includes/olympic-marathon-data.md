* Gold medal times for Olympic Marathon since 1896.
* Marathons before 1924 didnâ€™t have a standardized distance.
* Present results using pace per km.
* In 1904 Marathon was badly organized leading to very slow times.

\notes{The first thing we will do is load a standard data set for regression modelling. The data consists of the pace of Olympic Gold Medal Marathon winners for the Olympics from 1896 to present. Let's load in the data and plot.}

\notes{Things to notice about the data include the outlier in 1904, in that year the Olympics was in St Louis, USA. Organizational problems and challenges with dust kicked up by the cars following the race meant that participants got lost, and only very few participants completed. More recent years see more consistently quick marathons.}
