\subsection{Mauna Loa Data}

\notes{The Mauna Loa data consists of monthly mean carbon dioxide measured at Mauna Loa Observatory, Hawaii. According to the website, <https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/>.

> The carbon dioxide data on Mauna Loa constitute the longest record of direct measurements of CO2 in the atmosphere. They were started by C. David Keeling of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in March of 1958 at a facility of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration [@Keeling-atmospheric76]. NOAA started its own CO2 measurements in May of 1974, and they have run in parallel with those made by Scripps since then [@Thoning-atmospheric89].}

\notes{Additionally there are keys `Xtest` and `Ytest` which provide test data. The number of points considered to be *training data* is controlled by the argument `num_train` argument, which defaults to 545. This number is chosen as it matches that used in the [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW5.pdf) book [@Rasmussen:book06, Chapter 5]. Below we plot the test and training data.}
