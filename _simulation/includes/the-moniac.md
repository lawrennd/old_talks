\subsection{The MONIAC}

\notes{[The MONIAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MONIAC) was an analogue computer designed to simulate the UK economy. Analogue comptuers work through analogy, the analogy in the MONIAC is that both money and water flow. The MONIAC exploits this through a system of tanks, pipes, valves and floats that represent the flow of money through the UK economy. Water flowed from the treasury tank at the top of the model to other tanks representing government spending, such as health and education. The machine was initially designed for teaching support but was also found to be a useful economic simulator. Several were built and today you can see the original at Leeds Business School, there is also one in the London Science Museum and one [in the Unisversity of Cambridge's economics faculty](https://www.econ.cam.ac.uk/economics-alumni/drip-down-economics-phillips-machine).}
