\notes{We’re now in a new phase of the development of computing, with rapid
advances in machine learning. But we see some of the same issues –
researchers across disciplines hope to make use of machine learning,
but need access to skills and tools to do so, while the field
machine learning itself will need to develop new methods to tackle
some complex, ‘real world’ problems.}

\notes{It is with these challenges in mind that the Computer Lab has
started the Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery. This new
Programme is seeking to support researchers across the University to
develop the skills they need to be able to use machine learning and
AI in their research.}

\notes{To do this, the Programme is developing three areas of activity:}

\notes{* Research: we’re developing a research agenda that develops
and applies cutting edge machine learning methods to scientific
challenges, with three Accelerate Research fellows working directly on
issues relating to computational biology, psychiatry, and string theory. While we’re concentrating on STEM subjects for
now, in the longer term our ambition is to build links with the social
sciences and humanities.}

\notes{Progress so far includes: 

* Recruited a core research team working on the application of AI in mental health, bioinformatics, healthcare, string theory, and complex systems.

* Created a research agenda and roadmap for the development of AI in science. 

* Funded 9 interdisciplinary projects:

  * Antimicrobial resistance in farming

  * Quantifying Design Trade-offs in Electricity-generation-focused Tokamaks using AI
  
  * Automated preclinical drug discovery in vivo using pose estimation
  
  * Causal Methods for Environmental Science Workshop
  
  * Automatic tree mapping in Cambridge
  
  * Acoustic monitoring for biodiversity conservation
  
  * AI, mathematics and string theory
  
  * Theoretical, Scientific, and Philosophical Perspectives on Biological Understanding in the age of Artificial Intelligence
  
  * AI in pathology: optimising a classifier for digital images of duodenal biopsies}


\notes{* Teaching and learning: building on the teaching activities
already delivered through University courses, we’re creating a
pipeline of learning opportunities to help PhD students and
postdocs better understand how to use data science and machine
learning in their work. }

\notes{Progress so far includes:

Teaching and learning

* Brought over 250 participants from over 30 departments through tailored data science and machine learning for science training (Data Science Residency and Machine Learning Academy);

* Convened workshops with over 80 researchers across the University on the development of data pipelines for science;

* Delivered University courses to over 100 students in Advanced Data Science and Machine Learning and the Physical World.

* Online training course in Python and Pandas accessed by over 380 researchers.
}

\notes{* Engagement: we hope that Accelerate will help build a community
of researchers working across the University at the interface on
machine learning and the sciences, helping to share best
practice and new methods, and support each other in advancing
their research. Over the coming years, we’ll be running a
variety of events and activities in support of this.}

\notes{Progress so far includes:

* Launched a Machine Learning Engineering Clinic that has supported over 40 projects across the University with MLE troubleshooting and advice;

* Hosted and participated in events reaching over 300 people in Cambridge;

* Led international workshops at Dagstuhl and Oberwolfach, convening over 60 leading researchers;

* Engaged over 70 researchers through outreach sessions and workshops with the School of Clinical Medicine, the Faculty of Education, Cambridge Digital Humanities and the School of Biological Sciences.  }
