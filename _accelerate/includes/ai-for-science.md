\subsection{AI for Science}

\notes{Recent years have brought a lot of excitement about artificial intelligence, and its potential to revolutionise research.}

\notes{In some disciplines, machine learning is already supporting impressive
advances. Just this week, for example, we’ve seen headlines about new
work by DeepMind, using machine learning to predict patterns of
protein folding – an advance that could unlock the development of a
range of new drugs to treat different diseases.}

\notes{In other areas, there is clear potential for machine learning to make
a contribution, but current tools and techniques aren’t being used as
widely as they could be.}

> One of biology’s biggest mysteries is how proteins fold to create
> exquisitely unique three-dimensional structures. Every living thing –
> from the smallest bacteria to plants, animals and humans – is defined
> and powered by the proteins that help it function at the molecular
> level.
>
> So far, this mystery remained unsolved, and determining a single
> protein structure often required years of experimental effort. It’s
> tremendous to see the triumph of human curiosity, endeavour and
> intelligence in solving this problem. A better understanding of
> protein structures and the ability to predict them using a computer
> means a better understanding of life, evolution and, of course,
> human health and disease.
