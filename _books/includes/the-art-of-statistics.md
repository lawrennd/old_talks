\section{The Art of Statistics}

\notes{The statistician's craft is based on humility in front of data and developing the appropriate skeptical thinking around conclusions from data. The best book I've seen for developing that sense is Sir David Spiegelhalter's *Art of Statistics*.}

\notes{David's book [@Spiegelhalter-art19] brings important examples from statistics to life in an intelligent and entertaining way. It is highly readable and gives an opportunity to fast-track towards the important skill of data-skepticism that is the mark of a professional statistician.}
