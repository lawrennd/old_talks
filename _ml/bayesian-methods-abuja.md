title: "Bayesian Methods"
subtitle: Probabilistic Machine Learning
abstract: "In this session we review the *probabilistic* approach to machine learning. We start with a review of probability, and introduce the concepts of probabilistic modelling. We then apply the approach in practice to Naive Bayesian classification. 

In this session we review the probabilistic formulation of a classification model, reviewing initially maximum likelihood and the naive Bayes model."
