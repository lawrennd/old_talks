\newslide{Reminder on the Term "Bayesian"}

\slides{* We use Bayes' rule to invert probabilities in the Bayesian approach.
  * Bayesian is not named after Bayes' rule (v. common confusion). 
  * The term Bayesian refers to the treatment of the parameters as stochastic variables.
  * Proposed by @Laplace:memoire74 and @Bayes:doctrine63 independently.
  * For early statisticians this was very controversial (Fisher et al).}
