* Classification is discrete output.
* Regression is a continuous output.}

\notes{Classification is the case where our prediction function gives a discrete valued output, normally associated with a 'class'. Regression is an alternative approach where the aim is to predict a *continuous output*.

The name is a historical accident, it would be better to call regression 'curve fitting', or even split it into two parts 'interpolation', which is the practice of predicting a function value between existing data, and 'extrapolation', which is the practice of predicting a function value beyond the regime where we have data.}
