\notes{Any disruptive technical innovation has three components. Perhaps the most obvious is that there is technical innovation, but two more are important for innovation to reach its target, whether it's customers, patients or citizens of a country. First of all, the innovation needs to resolve a genuine business, customer or patient problem. That seems clear, but it is the first mistake of many to assume that their novel idea is applicable or somehow must help. Technological solutions have a manner of hypnotising those that develop them. There is a narrative around innovation that is distracting. The second mistake is to innovate to solve a business problem, but not understand the difficulties in deployment. Deployment can be challenging for many reasons whether they are technical or cultural. For example, to successfully deploy an innovation in the NHS it is likely that you need the body of NHS Consultants, Nurses and managers on board. Innovation can not be forced on people. Another challenge is existing ecosystems. I sometimes refer to it as *greenfields* innovation when innovation is taking place in a new ecosystem, but much of the time we are required to do *brownfields* innovation, i.e. innovate in an ecosystem that is already operational.}
