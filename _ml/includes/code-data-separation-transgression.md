\slides{
* Von Neuman Architecture:
  * Code and data integrated in memory
  
* Today (Harvard Architecture):
  * Code and data separated for security
}
\notes{The next wave of machine learning is a paradigm shift in the way we think about computer science.

Classical computer science assumes that 'data' and 'code' are separate, and this is the foundation of secure computer systems. In machine learning, 'data' is 'software', so the decision making is directly influenced by the data. We are short-circuiting a fundamental assumption of computer science, we are breeching the code/data separation.}

* Machine learning:
  * Software is data
  
* Machine learning is a high level breach of the code/data separation.

\notes{This means we need to revisit many of our assumptions and tooling around the machine learning process. In particular, we need new approaches to systems design, new approaches to programming languages that highlight the importance of data, and new approaches to systems security.}
