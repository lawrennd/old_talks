\slides{* Remain more important than ever.
* Provide sanity checks for our ideas and code.
* Enable us to visualize our analysis bugs.}

\notes{Despite the shift of emphasis, traditional statistical techniques are more important than ever. One of the few ways we have to validate the analyses we create is to make use of visualizations, randomized testing and other forms of statistical analysis. You will have explored some of these ideas in earlier courses in machine learning. In this unit we provide some review material in a practical sheet to bring some of those ideas together in the context of data science.}
