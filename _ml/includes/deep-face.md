\notes{The DeepFace architecture [@Taigman:deepface14] consists of layers that deal with *translation* invariances, known as convolutional layers. These layers are followed by three locally-connected layers and two fully-connected layers. Color illustrates feature maps produced at each layer. The neural network includes more than 120 million parameters, where more than 95% come from the local and fully connected layers.}
