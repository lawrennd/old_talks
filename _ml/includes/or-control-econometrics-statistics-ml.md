\newslide{The Tribal Mentality}
\slides{
* $\text{data} + \text{model}$ is *not* new.
    * Dates back to Newton, Laplace, Gauss 
* *Plethora* of fields: *E.g.* 
    * Operations Research
	* Control 
	* Econometrics
	* Statistics
	* Machine learning
	* Data science
}

\newslide{The Tribal Mentality}
\slides{
* This can lead to confusion:
    * Different academic fields are:
	    * Born in different eras
		* Driven by different motivations
		* Arrive at different solutions
}
\notes{Different academic fields are born in different eras, driven by different motivations and arrive at different solutions.}

\newslide{Tribalism Can be Good}
\slides{
* Allows for consensus on best practice.
* Shared set of goals
* Ease of commiunication
* Rapid deployment of robust solutions 
}
\notes{The separation between these fields can almost become tribal, and from one perspective this can be very helpful. Each tribe can agree on a common language, a common set of goals and a shared understanding of the approach they’ve chose for those goals. This ensures that best practice can be developed and shared and as a result quality standards rise.}

\newslide{Professional Tribes}
\slides{
* This is the nature of professions
    * lawyers
	* medics
	* doctors
	* engineers
	* accountants
}
\notes{This is the nature of our *professions*. Medics, lawyers, engineers and accountants all have a system of shared best practice that they deploy efficiently in the resolution of a roughly standardized set of problems where they deploy (broken leg, defending a libel trial, bridging a river, ensuring finances are correct).}

\notes{Control, statistics, economics, operations research are all established professions. Techniques are established, often at undergraduate level, and graduation to the profession is regulated by professional bodies.  This system works well as long as the problems we are easily categorized and mapped onto the existing set of known problems.}

\newslide{Different Views}
\slides{
$$\text{data} + \text{model}$$

* For OR, control, stats etc.
* More things *unite* us rather than *divide* us.
}

\notes{However, at another level our separate professions of OR, statistics and control engineering are just different views on the same problem. Just as any tribe of humans need to eat and sleep, so do these professions depend on data, modelling, optimization and decision-making.}

\newslide{We're no longer hunter gatherers ...}
\slides{
* The automation challenges we face require 
    * all of our best ideas.
	* rethinking what $\text{data}+\text{model}$ means
	* rapid deployment and continuous monitoring
* This is the era of *data science*
}
\notes{We are doing something that has never been done before, optimizing and evolving very large scale automated decision making networks. The ambition to scale and automate in a *data driven* manner means that a tribal approach to problem solving can hinder our progress. Any tribe of hunter gatherers would struggle to understand the operation of a modern city. Similarly, supply chain needs to develop cross-functional skill sets to address the modern problems we face, not the problems that were formulated in the past.}

\notes{Many of the challenges we face are at the interface between our tribal expertize. We have particular cost functions we are trying to minimize (an expertise of OR) but we have large scale feedbacks in our system (an expertise of control). We also want our systems to be adaptive to changing circumstances, to perform the best action given the data available (an expertise of machine learning and statistics).}

\notes{Taking the tribal analogy further, we could imagine each of our professions as a separate tribe of hunter-gathers, each with particular expertise (e.g. fishing, deer hunting, trapping). Each of these tribes has their own approach to eating to survive, just as each of our localized professions has its own approach to modelling. But in this analogy, the technological landscapes we face are not wildernesses, they are emerging metropolises. Our new task is to feed our population through a budding network of supermarkets. While we may be sourcing our food in the same way, this requires new types of thinking that don't belong in the pure domain of any of our existing tribes.}

\notes{For our biggest challenges, focusing on the differences between these fields is unhelpful, we should consider their strengths and how they overlap. Fundamentally all these fields are focused on taking the right action given the information available to us. They need to work in *synergy* for us to make progress.}

\recommendation{We should be aware of the limitations of a single tribal view of any of our problem sets. Where our modelling is dominated by one perspective (e.g. economics, OR, control, ML) we should ensure cross fertilization of ideas occurs through scientific review and team rotation mechanisms that embed our scientists (for a short period) in different teams across our organizations.}

\newslide{Discomfort and Disconformation}
\slides{
* Talking across field boundaries is *critical*.
* It helps us *disconfirm our beliefs*.
* It's not comfortable, but it's vital.
