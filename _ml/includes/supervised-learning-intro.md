\notes{Supervised learning is one of the most widely deployed machine learning technologies, and a particular domain of success has been *classification*. Classification is the process of taking an input (which might be an image) and categorizing it into one of a number of different classes (e.g. dog or cat). This simple idea underpins a lot of machine learning. By scanning across the image we can also determine where the animal is in the image.}
