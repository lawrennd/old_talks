\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/data-science/1024px-Lake_District_picture}{80%}}{For a data first architecture we need to clean our
data at source, rather than individually cleaning data for each
task. This involves a shift of focus from our inputs to our
outputs. We should provide data streams that are consumable by many
teams without purification.}{lake-district-stream}

\recommendation{We need to share best practice around data deployment across our teams. We should make best use of our processes where applicable, but we need to develop them to become *data first* organizations. Data needs to be cleaned at *output* not at *input*.}
