* Revisit that decision: follow the path of @Neal:bayesian94 and @MacKay:bayesian92.

* Consider the probabilistic approach.}
\notes{We're going to go revisit that decision, and follow the path of Radford Neal [@Neal:bayesian94] who, inspired by work of David MacKay [@MacKay:bayesian92] and others did his PhD thesis on Bayesian Neural Networks. If we take a Bayesian approach to parameter inference (note I am using inference here in the classical sense, not in the sense of prediction of test data, which seems to be a newer usage), then we don't wish to fit parameters at all, rather we wish to integrate them away and understand the family of functions that the model describes.}
