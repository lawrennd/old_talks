-   **data** : observations, could be actively or passively
    acquired (meta-data).

. . .

-   **model** : assumptions, based on previous experience (other data!
    transfer learning etc), or beliefs about the regularities of
    the universe. Inductive bias.

. . .

-   **prediction** : an action to be taken or a categorization or a
    quality score.

\notes{What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a combination of

$$\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}$$

where *data* is our observations. They can be actively or passively
acquired (meta-data). The *model* contains our assumptions, based on
previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come
from transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the
regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our
inductive biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a
categorization or a quality score. The reason that machine learning
has become a mainstay of artificial intelligence is the importance of
predictions in artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through computation.}
