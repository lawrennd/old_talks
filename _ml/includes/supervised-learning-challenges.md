\subsection{Supervised Learning Challenges}

\notes{There are three principal challenges in constructing a problem for supervised learning.}

1. choosing which features, $\inputVector$, are relevant in the prediction
2. defining the appropriate *class of function*, $\mappingFunction(\cdot)$.
3. selecting the right parameters, $\weightVector$.
