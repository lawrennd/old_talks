\notes{In Sheffield we created a suite of software tools
for 'Open Data Science'. Open data science is an approach to sharing code,
models and data that should make it easier for companies, health professionals
and scientists to gain access to data science techniques.

\notes{The software can be installed using

```
pip install pods
```

from the command prompt where you can access your python installation.}

The code is also available on github: <https://github.com/sods/ods>

Once ```pods``` is installed, it can be imported in the usual manner.}
