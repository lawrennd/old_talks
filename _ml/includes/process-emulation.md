* Use data to provide new approaches in control and optimization that should allow for emulation of human motor skills.

\notes{Machine learning aims to replicate processes through the direct use of data. When deployed in the domain of 'artificial intelligence', the processes that it is replicating, or *emulating*, are cognitive processes.}


\newslide{Process Emulation}

\slides{
* Key idea:  emulate the process as a mathematical function.
* Each function has a set of *parameters* which control its behaviour.
* *Learning* is the process of changing these parameters to change the shape of the function
* Choice of which class of mathematical functions we use is a vital component of our *model*. 
}

\notes{The first trick in machine learning is to convert the process itself into a *mathematical function*. That function has a set of parameters which control its behaviour. What we call learning is the adaption of these parameters to change the behavior of the function. The choice of mathematical function we use is a vital component of the model.}
