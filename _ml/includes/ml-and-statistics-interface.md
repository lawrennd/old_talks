\subsection{Lies and Damned Lies}

\notes{There is a quote, that is apocryphally credited to Disraeli by Mark Twain.

> There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and statistics

It stems from the late 19th century. From a time after Laplace, Gauss, Legendre and Galton made their forays into regression, but before Fisher,
Pearson and others had begun to formalize the process of estimation. Today, the academic discipline of statistics is so widely
understood to be underpinned by mathematical rigor that we typically drop the fu full title of *mathematical statistics*, but this history can be informative when looking at the new challenges we face.

The new phenomenon that underpins the challenges that Professor Efron outlines has been called "big data". The vast quantities of data that are accumulating in the course of normal human activities. Where people have seen data, they have also seen the potential to draw inferences, but there is a lack of rigor about some of the approaches that means today we can see a new phenomenon.

> There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies and big data

The challenge we face is to repeat the work of Fisher, Pearson, Gosset, Neyman etc and give the new wave of approaches a rigorous mathematical foundation.}
