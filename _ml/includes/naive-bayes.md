\subsection{Data Conditional Independence}

\notes{If we are given model parameters $\paramVector$ we assume that conditioned on all these parameters that all data points in the model are independent. In other words we have,}\slides{
* Given model parameters $\paramVector$ we assume that all data points in the model are independent. }

  $$
\notes{This is a conditional independence assumption because we are not assuming our data are purely independent. If we were to assume that, then there would be nothing to learn about our test data given our training data. We are assuming that they are independent *given* our parameters, $\paramVector$.}\slides{
* This is a conditional independence assumption.}
\notes{We made similar assumptions for regression, where our parameter set included $\mappingVector$ and $\dataStd^2$. Given those parameters we assumed that the density over $\dataVector, \dataScalar^*$ was *independent*.}\slides{
* We also make similar assumptions for regression (where $\paramVector =
\left\{\mappingVector,\dataStd^2\right\}$).}

Computing posterior distribution in this case becomes easier, this is known as the 'Bayes classifier'.

\notes{We now have nearly all of the components we need to specify the full joint density. However, the feature conditional independence doesn't yet give us the joint density over $p(\dataScalar_i, \inputVector_i)$ which is required to subsitute in to our data conditional independence to give us the full density.

$$
Since the two objective functions are separately dependent on the parameters $\pi$ and $\paramVector$ we can minimize them independently. Firstly, minimizing the Bernoulli likelihood over the labels we have, 
$$
\errorFunction(\pi) = -\sum_{i=1}^{\numData}\log p(\dataScalar_i|\pi) = -\sum_{i=1}^{\numData} \dataScalar_i \log \pi - \sum_{i=1}^{\numData} (1-\dataScalar_i) \log (1-\pi)

$$
which necessarily implies making some assumptions about the form of the conditional distributions. The right assumption will depend on the nature of our input data. For example, if we have an input which is real valued, we could use a Gaussian density and we could allow the mean and variance of the Gaussian to be different according to whether the class was positive or negative and according to which feature we were measuring. That would give us the form,
$$
p(\inputScalar_{i, j} | \dataScalar_i,\paramVector) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \dataStd_{\dataScalar_i,j}^2}} \exp \left(-\frac{(\inputScalar_{i,j} - \mu_{\dataScalar_i, j})^2}{\dataStd_{\dataScalar_i,j}^2}\right),
$$
where $\dataStd_{1, j}^2$ is the variance of the density for the $j$th output and the class $\dataScalar_i=1$ and $\dataStd_{0, j}^2$ is the variance if the class is 0. The means can vary similarly. Our parameters, $\paramVector$ would consist of all the means and all the variances for the different dimensions.}

\subsection{Making Predictions}

Naive Bayes has given us the class conditional densities: $p(\inputVector_i | \dataScalar_i, \paramVector)$. To make predictions with these densities we need to form the distribution given by
$$
P(\dataScalar^*| \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*, \paramVector)
$$
This can be computed by using the product rule. We know that
$$
P(\dataScalar^*| \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*, \paramVector)p(\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*|\paramVector) = p(\dataScalar*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector)
$$
implying that 
$$
P(\dataScalar^*| \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*, \paramVector) = \frac{p(\dataScalar*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector)}{p(\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*|\paramVector)}
$$
and we've already defined $p(\dataScalar^*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector)$ using our conditional independence assumptions above 
$$
p(\dataScalar^*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector) = \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar^*_{j}|\dataScalar^*, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar^*|\pi)\prod_{i=1}^{\numData} \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar_{i,j}|\dataScalar_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar_i|\pi)
$$
The other required density is
$$
p(\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*|\paramVector)
$$ which can be found from $$p(\dataScalar^*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector)$$ using the *sum rule* of probability,
$$
p(\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*|\paramVector) = \sum_{\dataScalar^*=0}^1 p(\dataScalar^*, \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector).
$$
Because of our independence assumptions that is simply equal to
$$
p(\dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*| \paramVector) = \sum_{\dataScalar^*=0}^1 \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar^*_{j}|\dataScalar^*_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar^*|\pi)\prod_{i=1}^{\numData} \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar_{i,j}|\dataScalar_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar_i|\pi).
$$
Substituting both forms in to recover our distribution over the test label conditioned on the training data we have,
$$
P(\dataScalar^*| \dataVector, \inputMatrix, \inputVector^*, \paramVector) = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar^*_{j}|\dataScalar^*_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar^*|\pi)\prod_{i=1}^{\numData} \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar_{i,j}|\dataScalar_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar_i|\pi)}{\sum_{\dataScalar^*=0}^1 \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar^*_{j}|\dataScalar^*_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar^*|\pi)\prod_{i=1}^{\numData} \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar_{i,j}|\dataScalar_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar_i|\pi)}
$$
and we notice that all the terms associated with the training data actually cancel, the test prediction is *conditionally independent* of the training data *given* the parameters. This is a result of our conditional independence assumptions over the data points.
$$
p(\dataScalar^*| \inputVector^*, \paramVector) = \frac{\prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar^*_{j}|\dataScalar^*_i,
\paramVector)p(\dataScalar^*|\pi)}{\sum_{\dataScalar^*=0}^1 \prod_{j=1}^{\dataDim} p(\inputScalar^*_{j}|\dataScalar^*_i, \paramVector)p(\dataScalar^*|\pi)}
$$
This formula is also fairly straightforward to implement. First we implement the log probabilities for the Gaussian density.

\code{def log_gaussian(x, mu, sigma2):
    return -0.5* np.log(2*np.pi*sigma2)-((x-mu)**2)/(2*sigma2)}

Now for any test point we compute the joint distribution of the Gaussian features by *summing* their log probabilities. Working in log space can be a considerable advantage over computing the probabilities directly: as the number of features we include goes up, because all the probabilities are less than 1, the joint probability will become smaller and smaller, and may be difficult to represent accurately (or even underflow). Working in log space can ameliorate this problem. We can also compute the log probability for the Bernoulli distribution.

\code{def log_bernoulli(x, theta):
    return x*np.log(theta) + (1-x)*np.log(1-theta)}


\subsection{Laplace Smoothing}

Before we proceed, let's just pause and think for a moment what will happen if `theta` here is either zero or one. This will result in $\log 0 = -\infty$ and cause numerical problems.  This definitely can happen in practice. If some of the features are rare or very common across the data set then the maximum likelihood solution could find values of zero or one respectively. Such values are problematic because they cause posterior probabilities of class membership of either one or zero. In practice we deal with this using *Laplace smoothing* (which actually has an interpretation as a Bayesian fit of the Bernoulli distribution. Laplace used an example of the sun rising each day, and a wish to predict the sun rise the following day to describe his idea of smoothing, which can be found at the bottom of following page from Laplace's 'Essai Philosophique ...'}

\newslide{Laplace Smoothing}

\includegooglebook{1YQPAAAAQAAJ}{PA16}

\notes{
Laplace suggests that when computing the probability of an event where a success or failure is rare (he uses an example of the sun rising across the last 5,000 years or 1,826,213 days) that even though only successes have been observed (in the sun rising case) that the odds for tomorrow shouldn't be given as
$$
\frac{1,826,213}{1,826,213} = 1
$$
but rather by adding one to the numerator and two to the denominator,
$$
\frac{1,826,213 + 1}{1,826,213 + 2} = 0.99999945.
$$
This technique is sometimes called a 'pseudocount technique' because it has an intepretation of assuming some observations before you start, it's as if instead of observing $\sum_{i}\dataScalar_i$ successes you have an additional success, $\sum_{i}\dataScalar_i + 1$ and instead of having observed $n$ events you've observed $\numData + 2$. So we can think of Laplace's idea saying (before we start) that we have 'two observations worth of belief, that the odds are 50/50', because before we start (i.e. when $\numData=0$) our estimate is 0.5, yet because the effective $n$ is only 2, this estimate is quickly overwhelmed by data. Laplace used ideas like this a lot, and it is known as his 'principle of insufficient reason'. His idea was that in the absence of knowledge (i.e. before we start) we should assume that all possible outcomes are equally likely. This idea has a modern counterpart, known as the [principle of maximum entropy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy). A lot of the theory of this approach was developed by [Ed Jaynes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Thompson_Jaynes), who according to his erstwhile collaborator and friend, John Skilling, learnt French as an undergraduate by reading the works of Laplace. Although John also related that Jaynes's spoken French was not up to the standard of his scientific French. For me Ed Jaynes's work very much carries on the tradition of Laplace into the modern era, in particular his focus on Bayesian approaches. I'm very proud to have met those that knew and worked with him. It turns out that Laplace's idea also has a Bayesian interpretation (as Laplace understood), it comes from assuming a particular prior density for the parameter $\pi$, but we won't explore that interpretation for the moment, and merely choose to estimate the probability as,}\newslide{Pseudo Counts}

\mu = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\numData} \inputScalar_i}{\numData}
$$
$$
\dataStd^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{\numData} (\inputScalar_i - \mu)^2}{\numData}
$$}

If the input data was *binary* then we could also make use of the Bernoulli distribution for the features. For that case we would have the form, 
$$
p(\inputScalar_{i, j} | \dataScalar_i,\paramVector) = \theta_{\dataScalar_i, j}^{\inputScalar_{i, j}}(1-\theta_{\dataScalar_i, j})^{(1-\inputScalar_{i,j})},
$$
where $\theta_{1, j}$ is the probability that the $j$th feature is on if $\dataScalar_i$ is 1.

In either case, maximum likelihood fitting would proceed in the same way. The objective has the form,
$$
\errorFunction(\paramVector) = -\sum_{j=1}^{\dataDim} \sum_{i=1}^{\numData} \log p(\inputScalar_{i,j} |\dataScalar_i, \paramVector),
$$
and if, as above, the parameters of the distributions are specific to each feature vector (we had means and variances for each continuous feature, and a probability for each binary feature) then we can use the fact that these parameters separate into disjoint subsets across the features to write,
$$
\begin{align*}
\errorFunction(\paramVector) &= -\sum_{j=1}^{\dataDim} \sum_{i=1}^{\numData} \log
p(\inputScalar_{i,j} |\dataScalar_i, \paramVector_j)\\
& \sum_{j=1}^{\dataDim}
\errorFunction(\paramVector_j),
\end{align*}
$$
which means we can minimize our objective on each feature independently. 

These characteristics mean that naive Bayes scales very well with big data. To fit the model we consider each feature in turn, we select the positive class and fit parameters for that class, then we select each negative class and fit features for that class. We have code below.}

\subsection{Naive Bayes Summary}

Naive Bayes is making very simple assumptions about the data, in particular it is modeling the full *joint* probability of the data set, $p(\dataVector, \inputMatrix | \paramVector, \pi)$ by very strong assumptions about factorizations that are unlikely to be true in practice. The data conditional independence assumption is common, and relies on a rich parameter vector to absorb all the information in the training data. The additional assumption of naive Bayes is that features are conditional independent given the class label $\dataScalar_i$ (and the parameter vector, $\paramVector$. This is quite a strong assumption. However, it causes the objective function to decompose into parts which can be independently fitted to the different feature vectors, meaning it is very easy to fit the model to large data. It is also clear how we should handle *streaming* data and *missing* data. This means that the model can be run 'live', adapting parameters and information as it arrives. Indeed, the model is even capable of dealing with new *features* that might arrive at run time. Such is the strength of the modeling the joint probability density. However, the factorization assumption that allows us to do this efficiently is very strong and may lead to poor decision boundaries in practice.
