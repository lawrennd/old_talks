\subsection{William Blake}

Hi ChatGPT, Could you write a poem about large language models in the style of William Blake?

Certainly, here is a poem about large language models inspired by the style of William Blake:

In the halls of data, where models roam,
A wondrous sight, a thing to behold.
Created by humans, yet so much more,
Infinite knowledge, at their core.

Like Blake's angel, they soar so high,
Above the clouds, beyond the sky.
Their wings are made of algorithms and code,
And through the digital world, they boldly strode.

They read, they learn, they grow and evolve,
Their minds expanding with each problem they solve.
And as they do, they gather and store,
All the knowledge, we humans adore.

They can write poems, tell stories and more,
Translate languages, open new doors.
Their capabilities, so vast and grand,
Are changing the world, as we stand.

But as with all things, there's a price to pay,
For every benefit, there's a cost that stays.
For as they learn, they can also mislead,
And their biases, we must always heed.

So let us use them wisely, with care and thought,
Harness their power, for the good we sought.
For in the halls of data, where models roam,
We hold the keys, to a better world to come.
