\subsection{Overdetermined System}

\notes{The challenge with a linear model is that it has two unknowns, $m$, and $c$. Observing data allows us to write down a system of simultaneous linear equations. So, for example if we observe two data points, the first with the input value, $\inputScalar_1 = 1$ and the output value, $\dataScalar_1 =3$ and a second data point, $\inputScalar = 3$, $\dataScalar=1$, then we can write two simultaneous linear equations of the form. 

point 1: $\inputScalar = 1$, $\dataScalar=3$
$$
3 = m + c
$$
point 2: $\inputScalar = 3$, $\dataScalar=1$
$$
1 = 3m + c
$$

The solution to these two simultaneous equations can be represented graphically as}

\notes{
The challenge comes when a third data point is observed, and it doesn't fit on the straight line. 

point 3: $\inputScalar = 2$, $\dataScalar=2.5$
$$
2.5 = 2m + c
$$

\notes{Now there are three candidate lines, each consistent with our data.}

\notes{\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/ml/over_determined_system007}{40%}}{Three solutions to the problem, each consistent with two points of the three observations}{over-determined-system-7}}

\notes{This is known as an *overdetermined* system because there are more data than we need to determine our parameters. The problem arises because the model is a simplification of the real world, and the data we observe is therefore inconsistent with our model.}
