\subsection{Regression Examples}

\slides{
* Predict a real value, $\dataScalar_i$ given some inputs $\inputVector_i$.
* Predict quality of meat given spectral measurements (Tecator data).
* Radiocarbon dating, the C14 calibration curve: predict age given quantity of C14 isotope.
* Predict quality of different Go or Backgammon moves given expert rated training data.
}

\notes{Regression involves predicting a real value, $\dataScalar_i$, given an input vector, $\inputVector_i$. For example, the Tecator data involves predicting the quality of meat given spectral measurements. Or in radiocarbon dating, the C14 calibration curve maps from radiocarbon age to age measured through a back-trace of tree rings. Regression has also been used to predict the quality of board game moves given expert rated training data.}
