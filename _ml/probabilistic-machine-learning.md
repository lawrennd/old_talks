title: "Probabilistic Machine Learning"
abstract: "In this session we review the *probabilistic* approach to machine learning. We start with a review of probability, and introduce the concepts of probabilistic modelling. We then apply the approach in practice to Naive Bayesian classification. 

In this session we review the Bayesian formalism in the context of linear models, reviewing initially maximum likelihood and introducing basis functions as a way of driving non-linearity in the model."
