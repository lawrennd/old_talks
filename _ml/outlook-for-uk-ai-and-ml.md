title: "Outlook for UK AI and Machine Learning"
abstract: >
  Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep
  learning methods, form an underpinning of the current revolution in
  “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines
  and is having a significant influence on the wider tech agenda.
  
  In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with
  machine learning solutions, and what challenges we face both in the
  near and far future. These include practical application of existing
  algorithms in the face of the need to explain decision making,
  mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data,
  dealing with large unstructured datasets.

\section{Introduction}

\notes{The aim of this presentation is give a sense of the current situation in machine learning and artificial intelligence as well as some perspective on the immediate outlook for the field.}

\notes{This presentation represents my personal opinion as an academic with 20 years experience in machine learning, computational biology and data science. This is not in any sense *Amazon* policy, but since September 2016 I have been on leave of absence at Amazon.}

* In this "vanilla" form these machines "don't know when they don't know".
* Doubt is vital in real world decision making. 
* Incorporating this in systems is a long time focus of my technical research.

\slides{
* The emulation of intelligence does not exhibit all the meta-modelling humans perform.
