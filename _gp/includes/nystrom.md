\notes{The Nystr\"om approximation takes the form,}
$$
\Kff \approx \Qff = \Kfu \Kuu^{-1}\Kuf
$$
\notes{The idea is that instead of inverting $\Kff$, we make a low rank (or Nystr√∂m) approximation, and invert $\Kuu$ instead.

In the original Nystr\"om method the columns to incorporate are sampled from the complete set of columns (without replacement). In a kernel matrix each of these columns corresponds to a data point. In the Nystr\"om method these points are sometimes called *landmark* points.}
