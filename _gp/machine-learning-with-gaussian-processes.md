title: Machine Learning with Gaussian Processes
abstract: |
  Gaussian processes (GPs) provide a principled probabilistic approach
  to prior probability distributions for functions. In this talk we
  will give an overview of some uses of GPs and their extensions. In
  particular we will introduce mechanistic models alongside GPs and
  also use GPs within the framework of latent variable models.
