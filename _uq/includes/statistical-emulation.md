\notes{A statistical emulator is a data-driven model that learns about the underlying simulation. Importantly, learns with uncertainty, so it 'knows what it doesn't know'. In practice, we can call the emulator in place of the simulator. If the emulator 'doesn't know', it can call the simulator for the answer.}

\notes{As well as reconstructing an individual simulator, the emulator can calibrate the simulation to the real world, by monitoring differences between the simulator and real data. This allows the emulator to characterise where the simulation can be relied on, i.e. we can validate the simulator.}

\notes{Similarly, the emulator can adjudicate between simulations. This is known as *multi-fidelity emulation*. The emulator characterizes which emulations perform well where.

If all this modelling is done with judiscious handling of the uncertainty, the *computational doubt*, then the emulator can assist in desciding what experiment should be run next to aid a decision: should we run a simulator, in which case which one, or should we attempt to acquire data from a real world intervention.}
