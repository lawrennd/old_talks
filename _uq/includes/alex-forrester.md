\notes{We're going to make use of the Forrester function in our example below, a function developed as a demonstrator by [Alex Forrester](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/engineering/research/groups/performance-sports/staff-profiles/alexander-forrester.page). Alex is a design engineer who makes extensive use of surrogate modelling in Engineering design. 

You can see Alex talking about the use of Gaussian process surrogates [in this online video lecture](http://videolectures.net/mla09_forrester_sbcmoo/).}

\notes{The Forrester function [@Forrester-engineering08] is commonly used as a demonstrator function in surrogate modelling. It has the form}
$$
f(x) = (6x-2)^2\sin(12 x-4).
$$

\code{x = np.linspace(0, 1, 100)
f = (6*x-2)**2 * np.sin(12*x-4)}
