title: "The Atomic Human and Implications for AI and Professonal Services"
abstract: |
  A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we're having
  about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our identity?
 
  Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human
  intelligence. We believe it's what differentiates us. Fears of AI
  not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the
  implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our
  position at the centre of the world.
 
  Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to
  continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components:
  eventually we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek
  for uncuttable is 'atom'). In the same way, by slicing away at the
  facets of human intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI
  uncovers what is left: an indivisible core that is the essence of
  humanity.
 
  By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence
  with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The
  Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and
  limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just
  by the experts, but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or
  we become a tool of AI. Understanding this will enable us to choose
  the future we want.
 
  This talk is based on Neil's forthcoming book to be published with
  Allen Lane in June 2024. Machine learning solutions, in particular
  those based on deep learning methods, form an underpinning of the
  current revolution in "artificial intelligence" that has dominated
  popular press headlines and is having a significant influence on the
  wider tech agenda.
  
  In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with
  machine learning solutions, and what challenges we face both in the
  near and far future. These include practical application of existing
  algorithms in the face of the need to explain decision making,
  mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data,
  dealing with large unstructured datasets.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\notes{The probabilistic modelling community has evolved in an era where the assumption was that ambiguous conclusions are best shared with a (trained) professional through probabilities. Recent advances in generative AI offer the possibility of machines that have a better understanding of human subjective ambiguities and therefore machines that can summarise information in a way that can be interogated rather than just through a series of numbers.}

\slides{* HAMs change how we share ambiguous information.
* We need to think about how that effects our sharing of proabilities.}
