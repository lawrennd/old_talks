title: "Embodiment Factors and Privacy"
abstract: >
  In this talk we will explore a fundamental limitation of human
  intelligence which, we argue, makes privacy absolutely critical. We
  will relate this to our machine intelligences and speculate about
  how there may be challenges at the interace. Finally we propose Data
  Trusts as a solution for these challenges.

<!--Ruth Gavison:

don't conflate privacy and the private
Balance between private and public.
Public makes free. No!

Circle vs 1984

Invisible Man

Corporate vs State

Hollrith Calculating machines vs ebola

Consent is neither necessary nor sufficient for giving up privacy.-->
