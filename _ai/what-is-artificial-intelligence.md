\subsection{Challenges when AI Meets the Real World}

In practice there are serious challenges when AI meets the real world. Firstly, the AI represents an intelligence that is not embodied in the way we expect and reasons in a way that we don't understand. That effects how we assimilate AI within the cognitive landscape. There is a power asymmetry where companies that control our data make individually inconsequential decisions about us based on this data, but accumulated these decisions have a consequential effect. Yet we have no practical say in how those decisions are being made. We will review that challenge with *data trusts* below.

First we consider the challenge of designing and deploying large scale machine learning solutions.}
