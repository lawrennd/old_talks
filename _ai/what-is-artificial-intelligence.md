\subsection{Challenges when AI Meets the Real World}

In practice there are serious challenges when AI meets the real world. Firstly, the AI represents an intelligence that is not embodied in the way we expect and reasons in a way that we don't understand. That effects how we assimilate AI within the cognitive landscape. There is a power asymmetry where companies that control our data make individually inconsequential decisions about us based on this data, but accumulated these decisions have a consequential effect. Yet we have no practical say in how those decisions are being made. We will review that challenge with *data trusts* below.

First we consider the challenge of designing and deploying large scale machine learning solutions.}

\notes{In conclusion we consider five AI myths. Seemingly commonly accepted ideas that aren't true about our AI futures.}

\subsection{Five AI Myths}

1. AI will be the first wave of automation that adapts to us.
2. There is value locked into data which is thoughtlessly collected.
3. The big tech companies have the landscape all 'sewn up'
4. There is a new emergent class of 'data scientist' that will solve all problems.
5. The normal rules of business don't apply to AI.
