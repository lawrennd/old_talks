title: "Once Upon a Universal Standard Time: Embodiment and AI Narratives"
abstract: >
  In this talk we consider a fundamental difference between human and
  machine intelligence, a ratio between their ability to compute and
  their ability to communicate we refer to as the embodiment
  factor. Having suggested why this makes us fundamentally different
  we speculate on implications for developing *narrative* structure
  from data.
