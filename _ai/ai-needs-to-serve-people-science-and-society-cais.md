abstract: As artificial intelligence becomes ubiquitous in our homes and workplaces, we need to develop a widespread understanding of what it is and how we use it in the interests of our societies. Neil will discuss how the artificial systems we have developed operate in a fundamentally different way to our own intelligence and how this difference in operational capability leads us to misunderstand the influence that decisions made by machine intelligence are having on our lives. Without this understanding we cannot take back control of those decisions from the machine. This will set the scene for approaches we are taking in Cambridge to address these challenges such as AI@Cam, the University’s flagship mission on AI.

\notes{In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy. One consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is positioned, like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution. Whether it is overcoming industry’s productivity challenges, or as a salve for strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing global challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an elixir to resolve society’s problems.

In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit is not simple. Moreover, a growing body of evidence shows that risks and benefits from AI innovations are unevenly distributed across society.

When carelessly deployed, AI risks exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities.}

\notes{And this is very likely true, but in practice we know that even if the disruption is being felt initially by the professional classes, those groups tend to be protected by their ability to adapt, which is correlated with higher education.}

\notes{Whether this remains true this time is another question. I'm particularly struck by the "convergent evolution" of ChatGPT. The model is trained by reinforcement learning with feedback provided by people. ChatGPT's answers are highly plausible, make use of sophisticated language in an intelligent sounding way and are often incorrect. I'm struck by the similarity to fresh Oxbridge graduates. I wonder if this is also an example of convergent evolution.}

\notes{I'm reminded of this because from 2015 to 2017 I was on the Working Group that compiled the Royal Society's machine learning report. The process of constructing the report went across the UK Referendum, and the 2016 US election. I remember vividly a meeting we convened at the Society in London which had experts alongside MPs from all parties, policy advisors and civil servants. One of the MPs (likely correctly) pointed out "I suspect no one around this table voted for Brexit" to which I replied "But isn't that the problem? There are a large number of people who aren't empowered  who are experiencing quite a different reality than us. And they aren't reprented in these forums." So it's no surprise that so much of the press conversation around AI is still focussed on how it is likely to effect middle class jobs. We shouldn't underestimate these effects, but it's often the case that better educated people are better placed to deal with such challenges. For example, when stock brokers' roles disappeared they simply moved on to other roles in banks and related industries.}

\notes{Modern artificial intelligence solutions are using very large amounts of data to build a landscape in which this interpolation can take place. Tools like ChatGPT are allowing us to interpolate between different human concepts. This is an amazing achievement, but it is also a challenge.}

\notes{Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology development with public interests demands effective stakeholder engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology design.}

\notes{Building this pipeline will take coordination across research, engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be overcome – AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible solutions.}

\notes{\subsection{Making AI equitable}}

\notes{AI@Cam is a new flagship University mission that seeks to address these challenges. It recognises that development of safe and effective AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of expertise from across research domains, businesses, policy-makers, civill society, and from affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science, citizens and society.}

\notes{This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University’s vibrant interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form partnerships between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed equity and inclusion. It will develop new platforms for innovation and knowledge transfer. It will deliver innovative interdisciplinary teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It will build strong connections between the University and national AI priorities.}

\notes{The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and steward of those innovations.}

\notes{AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to deliver societal benefit and mitigate social harm.}

\notes{In that sense AI@Cam’s mission is close in spirit to that of Panacea’s elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and maintaining the hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research ecosystem.}
