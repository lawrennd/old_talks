\speakernotes{Computers are better balanced, they are lower powered, but because they have high bandwidth communication they can deploy all their power on the track.}

\speakernotes{Most people think of  intelligence as Sherlock Holmes like deduction. But actually what we can achiee is closer to what a spiritualist might do when cold reading. Understanding of statistics, no rationalisation.}

\includejpg{\diagramsDir/ai/mechanical-elephant}{80%}

\speakernotes{So in reality what we’ve created is much more akin to a mechanical elephant. One that takes inputs and feeds back responses.}

\includejpg{\diagramsDir/ai/the-hindoo-earth}{70%}

\speakernotes{Or perhaps a better analogy is that we’ve created the turtle. System Zero in the Kahneman parlance. A large data aware organ that operates at a level below our subconscious.}

\speakernotes{We’ve developed institutions such as medicine and banks that ensure we understand when to trust and how to trust. Trust is critical to our mode of operation.}

\includejpg{\diagramsDir/rothenburg-of-the-deaf-1624164_1920}{60%}

\speakernotes{Current approach to security is that we are either locked away or not, this does not map well to our notion of trust.}

\includejpg{\diagramsDir/Medievalplowingwoodcut}{90%}

\speakernotes{It feels very much akin to the Medieval open field system. There are two ways in which our data I stored, either on our behalf by the “Lord of the Manor” or openly akin to the common land.}


\newslide{}

\includejpg{\diagramsDir/elephant-1065632_1920}{90%}

\speakernotes{If we could understand how to translate human notions of trust into the digital world then we would be better placed to operate with our traditional freedoms intact.}
