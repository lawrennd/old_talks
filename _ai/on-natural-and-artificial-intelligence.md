- The challenges of this new form of systems design have already been explored in systems biology, a field dedicated to the reverse engineering of biological systems. As many researchers have found, classical approaches to reverse engineering, which typically involve subjecting the system to a perturbation. In other words actively changing the system, to obtain a deeper understanding of behaviour normally fail because a natural system will often compensate. Survival dictates that there should be back up systems that kick in. 
- Robust approaches to systems design for the “don’t fail” predicate are beyond the scope of current engineering practice. They require uncertainty, best default behaviours, worst case analyses. They require you to consider how your artificial intelligence should respond to a mischievous 10 year old.

\section{Conclusions}
\newslide{Conclusion I}

* We are a *long* way from emulating human intelligence, animal intelligence, animal motion. 
* The objectives of *cybernetics* still have not been reached. 
* The *robustness* of natural systems is outside the scope of our current design methodologies.


\newslide{Conclusion II}

* There is something quintisential about the *human* experience.
* We are co-evolved to view the world in a certain way to enable collaboration.
* Our consciousness is a consequence of our limitations. Our *locked-in* intelligence.
