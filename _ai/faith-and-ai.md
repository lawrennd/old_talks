title: "Faith and AI"
abstract: "What is artificial intelligence and what are the implications of advances in artificial intelligence for religion? In this talk we give a short introduction to the technology that's underpinning advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning. We then develop those ideas with a particular focus on how artificial intelligences differ from *natural* intelligences. Next, we consider parallels between the perspectives on religion and AI in popular culture, initially with a 'cartoon view', but then diving deeper and reflecting on the shared drive for introspection that a mature approach to artificial intelligence and religion might bring."
