title: "The AI Paradigm Shift: Machine Learning, Automated Decision Making and Modern Society"
abstract: |
  The term Artificial Intelligence means different things to different people, but we can distil some commonality across different expectations of the term. It seems that the word intelligence drives us to believe that this new approach to automation will be the first to adapt to us as humans rather than requiring us to adapt to it. This promise presents challenges, because machine learning technologies that underpin the revolution in artificial intelligence are not capable of adapting to humans as we are to each other. In this talk we introduce the challenges and overview the research directions we are taking to uncover the solutions.

\notes{In large part, these challenges associated with AI are because AI has no understanding of the human condition. But there's also a problem that we don't have an intuitive understanding of AI and how it is working.}

\notes{The marvellous resolution does not apply to machine driven decisions, because we *don't* have an intuitive understanding of what motivates the machine.}

\aligncenter{If AI isn't a tool for us, then we are the tool of AI.}

\notes{The consequence is that the AI, driven by it's detailed knowledge of who we are, arising from its access to large quantities of our data, can undermine the delicate balance of our decision-making, and replace our objectives with it's own simplistic ideas of how things should be.}

\notes{The third intervention goes direct to the source of the machine's power. What we are seeing is an emergent *[digital oligarchy](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/mar/05/digital-oligarchy-algorithms-personal-data)* based on the power that comes with aggregation of data. [Data Trusts](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-feudalism-democracy) are form of data intermediary designed to reutrn the power associated with this data accumulation to the originators of the data, that is us.}
