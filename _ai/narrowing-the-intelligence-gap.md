title: "Narrowing the Intelligence Gap"
abstract: >
  How are we making computers do the things we used to associate only with humans? Have we made a breakthrough in understanding human intelligence?
  
  While recent achievements might give the sense that the answer is yes, the short answer is that we are nowhere near. All we’ve achieved for the moment is a breakthrough in emulating intelligence. In this talk we discuss two differences between the artificial intelligence we’ve deployed and the natural intelligence we exhibit. Resolving one is a challenge of changing the way we do systems design, the other, we argue, is a more fundamental difference that may never be overcome.

\subsection{Conclusion}

\slides{* We are defined by our limitations.
* We can emulate tasks we perform.
* But the essence of human intelligence may always be out of reach.
}

\notes{Great advances have been made in artificial intelligence, but as we chip away at our notions of what human intelligence means we discover that we are more defined by our limitations than our capabilities. We can emulate tasks we do, but the essence of human intelligence will remain out of reach from artificial entities that do not have the same constraints on life. 

As a result, I hope/believe that over time we will come to treasure our social intelligence more and celebrate that which is specific to us.}
