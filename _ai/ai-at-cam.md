abstract: Artificial intelligence offers great promise, but we must ensure it does not deepen inequalities.  Today we are setting out our vision for AI@Cam, a new flagship mission at the University of Cambridge.

\subsection{Artificial intelligence today is ubiquitous}

It is deployed in health to map the consequences of genetic variation in
cancer. It is helping researchers find new
[pulsars](https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/443/2/1651/1058949)
and
[planets](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2021/11/aa41471-21/aa41471-21.html%20)
It is providing faster approaches for [solving complex
equations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.08895) to support
climate science.

Cambridge has already made important contributions across these fields.
Shankar Balasubramanian and David Klenerman revolutionised the field of
genomics with their [rapid sequencing
technology](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/journeysofdiscovery-rapidgenomesequencing).
Jocelyn Bell Burnell and Tony Hewish discovered a new class of
astronomical object when they [observed the first
pulsar](https://www.cam.ac.uk/stories/journeysofdiscovery-pulsars).
Maurice Wilkes and David Wheeler showed the power of technology for
problem solving, being the first to [solve a differential equation with
a digital
computer](https://www.jstor.org/stable/3001780?seq=1).
These advances in science and technology created new understandings of
the world, and in turn provided new tools that pushed forward the
frontiers of science.

The pervasiveness of AI sets it apart from other areas of technology
innovation, such as nanotechnologies, graphene, or fusion. AI is both a
rapidly-advancing research domain and an accelerator of innovation in
other disciplines and industry sectors.

#### It is also a technology that is intertwined with diverse societal interests. **Its impact is felt across society.**

\section{AI: a global panacea?}

In Greek mythology, Panacea was the goddess of the universal remedy. One
consequence of the pervasive potential of AI is that it is positioned,
like Panacea, as the purveyor of a universal solution. Whether it is
overcoming industry's productivity challenges, or as a salve for
strained public sector services, or a remedy for pressing global
challenges in sustainable development, AI is presented as an elixir to
resolve society's problems.

In practice, translation of AI technology into practical benefit [is not
simple](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09926%20). Moreover,
a growing body of evidence shows that risks and benefits from AI
innovations are unevenly distributed across society.

#### When carelessly deployed, **AI risks exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities**.

Innovating to serve science and society requires a pipeline of
interventions. As well as advances in the technical capabilities of AI
technologies, engineering knowhow is required to safely deploy and
monitor those solutions in practice. Regulatory frameworks need to adapt
to ensure trustworthy use of these technologies. Aligning technology
development with public interests demands effective stakeholder
engagement to bring diverse voices and expertise into technology design.

Building this pipeline will take coordination across research,
engineering, policy and practice. It also requires action to address the
digital divides that influence who benefits from AI advances. These
include digital divides within the socioeconomic strata that need to be
overcome -- AI must not exacerbate existing equalities or create new
ones. In addressing these challenges, we can be hindered by divides that
exist between traditional academic disciplines. We need to develop
common understanding of the problems and a shared knowledge of possible
solutions.


\section{Making AI equitable}


[AI@Cam](https://www.cam.ac.uk/ai) is a new flagship University mission
that seeks to address these challenges. It recognises that development
of safe and effective AI-enabled innovations requires this mix of
expertise from across research domains, businesses, policy-makers,
civill society, and from affected communities. AI@Cam is setting out a
vision for AI-enabled innovation that benefits science, citizens and
society.

This vision will be achieved through leveraging the University's vibrant
interdisciplinary research community. AI@Cam will form partnerships
between researchers, practitioners, and affected communities that embed
equity and inclusion. It will develop new platforms for innovation and
knowledge transfer. It will deliver innovative interdisciplinary
teaching and learning for students, researchers, and professionals. It
will build strong connections between the University and national AI
priorities.

The University operates as both an engine of AI-enabled innovation and
steward of those innovations.

#### AI is not a universal remedy. It is a set of tools, techniques and practices that correctly deployed can be leveraged to **deliver societal benefit and mitigate social harm**.

In that sense AI@Cam's mission is close in spirit to that of Panacea's
elder sister Hygeia. It is focussed on building and maintaining the
hygiene of a robust and equitable AI research ecosystem.

[Our review](https://www.cam.ac.uk/system/files/aicam_review_april22.pdf),
published today, signals the University's commitment to this new wave of
AI-enabled research and innovation. We look forward to playing an active
role in sharing the benefits of that technology across society.
