title: "Intellectual Debt and the Death of the Programmer"
abstract: >
  Technical debt is incurred when complex systems are rapidly deployed without due thought as to how they will be *maintained*. Intellectual debt is incurred when complex systems are rapidly deployed without due thought to how they'll be *explained*.
  
  Both problems are pervasive in the design and deployment of large scale algorithmic decision making engines. 
  
  In this talk we'll review the origin of the problem, and propose a roadmap for obtaining solutions. It's a journey that will require collaboration between industry, academia, third sector, and government.

-   Technical debt is the inability to *maintain* your complex software
    system.

-   Intellectual debt is the inability to *explain* your software
    system.

1.  A general-purpose stream algebra that encodes relationships between

2.  A Scala library for building programs in that algebra.

3.  A compiler that takes programs expressed in Milan IL and produces a
     Flink application that executes the program.

\section{Conclusion}
\slides{
* AI Fallacy incorrectly suggests machines will adapt to us.
* Reality is a greater need for explanation of decision making.
* Roadmap to address this challenge involves:
  * The Milan IL Algebra
  * Meta modelling with e.g. Emukit
