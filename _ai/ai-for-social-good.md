title: "AI for Social Good"
abstract: >
  Artificial Intelligence has been hailed as the "Fourth Industrial Revolution". If it is such a revolution, it will be (1) the first to have been named before it has happened. (2) a cause of disruption for our work and society. 
  
  In this talk I will consider the notion of "AI for Social Good", by taking a look at ways in which the technology may disrupt and how we might react by adapting or improving our situation. I'll particularly focus on deployment of ML in developing economies.
