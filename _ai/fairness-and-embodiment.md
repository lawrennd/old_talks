title: "Fairness and Embodiment Factors"
abstract: "Where does the need for fairness come from? And what are the pitfalls in achieving fairness. In this short discussion trigger we argue that they arise from fundamental limitations to how our intelligence can be communicated, but that the need for individual authorship is in tension with a shared need for cultural understanding."
