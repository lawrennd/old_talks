  The British Science Association hosts a series of debates to
  encourage constructive debate about science's role in people's
  lives, economy and the UK's future. This debate was hosted by the
  Sheffield association and was focussed on artificial
  intelligence. The debate was led by two speakers from Sheffield's
  Debating Society with Tony Dodd supporting the 'against' and myself
  supporting the 'for'.
