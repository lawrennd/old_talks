\section{The Great AI Fallacy}

\notes{There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial intelligence. I'm sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether you're speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the term differs.

However, underlying its use I've detected one disturbing trend. A trend I'm beginining to think of as  "The Great AI Fallacy".

The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded in
many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence,
as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated decision making.
The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that it will be the
first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the human, rather
than the human adapting to the machine.

How else can we explain the suspension of sensible business judgment
that is accompanying the hype surrounding AI?

This fallacy is particularly pernicious because there are serious
benefits to society in deploying this new wave of data-driven automated
decision making. But the AI Fallacy is causing us to suspend our
calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these systems safely and
efficiently.

The problem is compounded because many of the techniques that we're
speaking of were originally developed in academic laboratories in
isolation from real-world deployment.}
