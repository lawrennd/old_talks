\subsection{A Definition of Intelligence}

\notes{The word intelligence is heavily overloaded, it means different things to different people. My own definition for intelligence is as follows [@Lawrence:embodiment17]. Intelligence is the use of information to achieve a goal with less resource. Here information is often in the form of data, resource is often energy (or strictly speaking free energy). 

This implies a more intelligent decision is one that either used less information and the same amount of resource or less resource for the same information, or any interpolation between.}
