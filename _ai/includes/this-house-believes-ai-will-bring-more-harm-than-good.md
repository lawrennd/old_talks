title: "This House Believes AI will Bring More Harm than Good"
abstract: >
  AI research seeks to build machines that can reason, learn and act intelligently. Within the near future major advancements in machine functionality are expected in a plethora of fields. However, we are still likely very far from the day where a machine's intellectual capacity will surpass the one of a human being. In the scope of the debate we explore whether humanity should welcome or have concerns about the potential applications of Artificial Intelligence. To balance between scientific claims and argumentation of a highly speculative nature we focus the debate on the prospective developments likely in the upcoming decade (2020-2030).

Gist.

Human intelligence is flexible, Artificial intelligence is not. 

More restrictions on freedoms. More ill considered interventions.-->
