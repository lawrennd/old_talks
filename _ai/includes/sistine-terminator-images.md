\notes{[Patrick Boyde](https://www.mmll.cam.ac.uk/pb127)'s talks on the Sistine Chapel focussed on both the structure of the chapel ceiling, describing the impression of height it was intended to give, as well as the significance and positioning of each of the panels and the meaning of the individual figures.}

\notes{One of the most famous panels is central in the ceiling, it's the creation of man. Here, God in the guise of a pink-robed bearded man reaches out to a languid Adam.}

\notes{The representation of God in this form seems typical of the time, because elsewhere in the Vatican Museums there are similar representations.}

\notes{Sometimes, this image is even combined with that of God to create what [Beth Singler](https://bvsingler.com), a digital anthropologist who is a JRF at Hmerton College, refers to as the creation meme [@Singler-aicreation20].}

\notes{So in a very real sense, we can see that both God and AI are viewed by us as embodied intelligences, whether creator or created. We show these other-intelligences in a humanoid form.}
