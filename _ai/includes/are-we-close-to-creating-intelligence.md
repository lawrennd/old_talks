\notes{*How are we making computers do the things we used to associated only with humans? Have we made a breakthrough in understanding human intelligence?*

While recent achievements might give the sense that the answer is yes, the short answer is that we are nowhere near. All we’ve achieved for the moment is a breakthrough in *emulating intelligence*. }

\newslide{Two Answers}
\slides{
1. Current technology is a long way from emulating all aspects of human intelligence: there are a number of technological breakthroughs that remain before we crack the fundamental nature of human intelligence.

. . .

2. More controversially, I believe that there are aspects of human intelligence that we will never be able to emulate, a preserve that remains uniquely ours.
