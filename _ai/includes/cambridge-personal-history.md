\notes{Cambridge has been involved in the formulation of the methods used in the current wave of AI solutions since their beginnings. In 1997 I attend the Machine Learning and Generalisation Summer School at the Newton Institute. There we heard from many of those who developed the methods that are foundational to the recent wave of progress, including Geoff Hinton and Yann LeCun.}

\notes{My own understanding of why we might want to picture these intelligences as embodied goes back to lectures I heard at the institute by David MacKay. By the time I arrived in Cambridge, David was very focussed on the relationships between learning and information theory, and as well as his lecture at the Newton Institute, his group meetings were focussed on information theory and machine learning.}
