\notes{SafeBoda and other projects like [Kudu](https://kudu.ug/about/) provide us with our motivating examples. Our aim is to create an ecosystem for machine learing system deployment that minimises the operational load. Ideally, we would like complex AI systems to be maintainable by a small team, e.g. two people, with Masters-level education from the institutions that host Data Science Africa (e.g. Ashesi University, Makerere University, Dedan Kimathi University of Technology, AUST, AIST, Addis Ababa).}

\notes{As of 24th October 2019, the [Turing Institute announced](https://www.turing.ac.uk/news/welcoming-world-class-turing-ai-fellows-institute) that this work has been funded through an Alan Turing Institute Senior AI Fellowship. This is the first Senior AI fellowship and it provides funding for five years. 

The project partners are [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com/),  [Open ML](https://openml.org), [Professor Sylvie Delacroix](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/law/delacroix-sylvie.aspx) and [Data Science Africa](http://datascienceafrica.org).}

There is no way that the team we're building will be able to deliver on this agenda alone, so please join us in addressing these challenges!}
