\subsection{$p$-Fairness and $n$-Fairness}

\figure{\includediagramclass{\diagramsDir/ai/n-p-fairness}{80%}}{We seem to have two different aspects to fairness, which in practice can be in tension.}{n-p-fairness}

\notes{We've outlined $n$-fairness and $p$-fairness. By $n$-fairness we mean the sort of considerations that are associated with *substantive* equality of opportunity vs *formal* equality of opportunity. Formal equality of community is related to $p$-fairness. This is sometimes called procedural fairness and we might think of it as a *performative* form of fairness. It's about clarity of rules, for example as applied in sport. $n$-Fairness is more nuanced. It's a reflection of society's normative judgment about how individuals may have been disadvantaged, e.g. due to their upbringing.}

\notes{The important point here is that these forms of fairness are in tension. Good procedural fairness needs to be clear and understandable. It should be clear to everyone what the rules are, they shouldn't be obscured by jargon or overly subtle concepts. $p$-Fairness should not be easily undermined by adversaries, it should be difficult to "cheat" good $p$-fairness. However, $n$-fairness requires nuance, understanding of the human condition, where we came from and how different individuals in our society have been advantaged or disadvantaged in their upbringing and their access to opportunity.}

\notes{Pure $n$-fairness and pure $p$-fairness both have the feeling of dystopias. In practice, any decision making system needs to balance the two. The correct point of operation will depend on the context of the decision. Consider fair rules of a game of football, against fair distribution of social benefit. It is unlikely that there is ever an objectively correct balance between the two for any given context. Different individuals will favour $p$ vs $n$ according to their personal values.}

\notes{Given the tension between the two forms of fairness, with $p$ fairness requiring simple rules that are understandable by all, and $n$ fairness requiring nuance and subtlety, how do we resolve this tension in practice?}

\notes{Normally in human systems, significant decisions involve trained professionals. For example, judges, or accountants or doctors.}

\notes{Training a professional involves lifting their "reflexive" response to a situation with "reflective" thinking about the consequences of their decision that rely not just on the professional's expertise, but also their knowledge of what it is to be a human.}

\notes{This *marvellous* resolution exploits the fact that while humans are increadibly complicated nuanced entities, other humans have an intuitive ability to understand their motivations and values. So the human is a complex entity that seems simple to other humans.}
