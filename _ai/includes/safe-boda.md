\notes{The complexity of building safe, maintainable systems that are based on interacting components which include machine learning models means that smaller companies can be excluded from access to these technologies due the technical and intellectual debt incurred when maintaining such systems in a real-world environment.}

\notes{[SafeBoda](https://safeboda.com/ug/index.php#whysafeboda) is a Kampala based rider allocation system for Boda Boda drivers. Boda boda are motorcycle taxis which give employment to, often young men, across Kampala. Safe Boda is driven by the knowledge that road accidents are set to match HIV/AIDS as the highest cause of death in low/middle income families by 2030.}

> With road accidents set to match HIV/AIDS as the highest cause of death in low/middle income countries by 2030, SafeBodaâ€™s aim is to modernise informal transportation and ensure safe access to mobility.

\notes{A key aim of the AutoAI agenda is to reduce these technical challenges, so that such software can be maintained safely and reliably by a small team of software engineers. Without this capability it is hard to imagine how low resource environments can fully benefit from the 'data revolution' without heavy reliance on technical provision from high-resource environments. Such dependence would inevitably mean a skew towards the challenges that high-resource economies face, rather than the more urgent and important problems that are faced in low-resource environments.}
