\subsection{Deploying Artificial Intelligence}
\slides{
* Challenges in deploying AI.
* Currently this is in the form of "machine learning systems"
}
\notes{With the wide availability of new techniques, we are currently creating Artificial Intelligence through combination of machine learning algorithms to form machine learning systems.}

\newslide{Internet of People}
\slides{
* Fog computing: barrier between cloud and device blurring.
    * Computing on the Edge
* Complex feedback between algorithm and implementation
}
\notes{This effect is amplified through the growth in sensorics, in particular the movement of cloud computing towards the customer. The barrier between cloud and device is blurring. This phenomenon is sometimes known as fog computing, or *computing on the edge*.}


\newslide{Deploying ML in Real World: Machine Learning Systems Design}
\slides{
* Major new challenge for systems designers.
* Internet of Intelligence but currently:
	* AI systems are *fragile*
}
\notes{This presents major new challenges for machine learning systems design. We would like an internet of *intelligence* but currently our AI systems are *fragile*. A classical systems approach to design does not handle evolving environments well.}
