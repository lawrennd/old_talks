\subsection{The Fourth Industrial Revolution}
\slides{* The first to be named before it happened.}

\notes{The fourth industrial revolution bears the particular hallmark of being the first revolution that has been named before it has happened. This is particularly unfortunate, because it is not in fact an industrial revolution at  all. Nor is it necessarily a distinct phenomenon. It is part of a revolution in information, one that goes back to digitisation and the invention of the silicon chip.}

\notes{Or to put it more precisely, it is a revolution in how information can affect the physical world. The interchange between information and the physical world.}
