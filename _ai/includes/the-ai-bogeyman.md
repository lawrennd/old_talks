\subsection{The Bogeyman Behind the Garage}

\notes{When my son, Fred, was three or four years old, we lived in an old Victorian house with a large garage that used to serve as a billiard room. Behind the garage was a big pile of rubbish, most of it extracted from the house by previous occupants as part of partially finished rennovations. There was broken glass, and nails and goodness knows what else under the pile.}

\notes{My Italian father in law was visiting us and we were together with Fred when he moved towards the back of the garage.}

\notes{"Don't go there there's a bogeyman behind the garage" called my father-in-law.}

\notes{This put me in a difficult position. I didn't want my son to go behind the garage, but I didn't want him to believe there was a bogeyman there. I wanted him to understand the actual risks and realise the dangers rather than worry about imaginary risks.}

\notes{But I didn't want to undermine my father-in-law as a fellow figure of authority, and I didn't want to confuse my son about the risks by explaining why what he'd said was problematic. The challenge was compounded by my limited Italian and my father-in-law's lack of English.}

\notes{The current debate around AI has put me in mind of the quandry I faced. Figures of authority, including the UK prime minister, seem to be warning the world of an "AI bogeyman".}

\notes{To be clear it's not that there weren't unknown risks behind my garage, there could have been asbestos in the pile, there could have been a rats' nest. There could even (conceivably) have been rats that had eaten asbestos becoming a sort of demonic diminuative bogey-rate. I couldn't rule that out.}

\notes{The same is true of the current AI conversation. The bogeyman risk we hear about is a conflation of two existing known risks: power asymmetries and the accountability of automated decision making systems. Put these two challenges together in their most extreme form, and you get an asbestos breathing rat. Something every child probably should have nightmares about. But the more plausible scenario is asbestos on its own or rats on their own.}

\notes{In the case of the UK government, I've been in a quandry for the last year about how to address the shift in the rhetoric that has emerged from No 10. In roles as a member of the AI Council and the Interim Chair of the CDEI I've felt an obligation to alert government to the real and present dangers that these technologies represent. I feel I have failed in that endeavour.}

\notes{But these few weeks have also given me great hope. The bogeyman arguments have rallied the wider community to be more vocal in pointing out the real challenges we face. The real social challenges are being surfaced on the fringe of the summit.}

\notes{The Prime Minister has claimed that an AI safety institute will asuage our fears by addressing the risks. But given the governments failure to correctly identify the risks. They are building a bogeyman catcher.}
