\subsection{Fire Control Systems}

\notes{Naval gunnery systems deal with targeting guns while taking into account movement of ships. The Royal Navy's Gunnery Pocket Book [@Admiralty-gunnery45] gives details of one system for gun laying.}

\notes{Like many challenges we face today, in the second world war, fire control was handled by a hybrid system of humans and computers. This means deploying human beings for the tasks that they can manage, and machines for the tasks that are better performed by a machine. This leads to a division of labour between the machine and the human that can still be found in our modern digital ecosystems.}

\notes{As analogue computers, fire control computers from the second world war would contain components that directly represented the different variables that were important in the problem to be solved, such as the inclination between two ships.}

\notes{The fire control systems were electro-mechanical analogue computers that represented the "state variables" of interest, such as inclination and ship speed with gears and cams within the machine.}
