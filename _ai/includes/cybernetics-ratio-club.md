* Cybernetics: Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine by [Norbert Wiener](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Wiener) (1948)
* [Ratio Club](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratio_Club) members include [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing), [Jack Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good), [Horace Barlow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horace_Barlow), [Donald MacKay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_MacCrimmon_MacKay)

\notes{Norbert Wiener launched last century’s first wave of interest in emulation of intelligence with his book “Cybernetics”. The great modern success that stemmed from that work is the modern engineering discipline of Automatic Control. The technology that allows fighter jets to fly. These ideas came out of the Second World War, when researchers explored the use of radar (automated sensing) and automatic computation for decryption of military codes (automated decision making). Post war a body of researchers, including Alan Turing, were seeing the potential for electronic emulation of what had up until then been the preserve of an animallian nervous system.}
