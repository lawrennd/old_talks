\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/ai/anne-llm-conversation}{80%}}{The focus so far has been on reducing uncertainty to a few representative values and sharing numbers with human beings. We forget that most people can be confused by basic probabilities for example the prosecutor's fallacy.}{anne-llm-conversation}

\slides{* LLMs are already being used for robot planning @Huang-inner22

* Ambiguities are reduced when the machine has had large scale access to human cultural understanding.}

\notes{By interacting directly with machines that have an understanding of human cultural context, it should be possible to share the nature of uncertainty in the same way humans do. See for example the paper [Inner Monologue: Embodied Reasoning through Planning](https://innermonologue.github.io/) @Huang-inner22.}
