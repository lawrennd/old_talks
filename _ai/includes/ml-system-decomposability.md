\subsection{Technical Consequence}
\slides{* Classical systems design assumes *decomposability*.
* Data-driven systems interfere with decomponsability.}
\notes{Classical systems design assumes that the system is decomposable. That we can decompose the complex decision making process into distinct and independently designable parts. The composition of these parts gives us our final system.}

\slides{
* The gap between the game and reality.
* The need for extrapolation over interpolation.

\notes{Nicolas Negroponte, the original founder of MIT's media lab used to write a column called 'bits and atoms'. This referred to the ability of information to effect movement of goods in the physical world. It is this interaction where machine learning technologies have the possibility to bring most benefit.}
