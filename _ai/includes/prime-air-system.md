\subsection{Prime Air}

\notes{One project where the components of machine learning and the physical world come together is Amazon's Prime Air drone delivery system.}

\notes{Automating the process of moving physical goods through autonomous vehicles completes the loop between the 'bits' and the 'atoms'. In other words, the information and the 'stuff'. The idea of the drone is to complete a component of package delivery, the notion of last mile movement of goods, but in a fully autonomous way.}

\notes{As Jeff Wilke (who was CEO of Amazon Retail at the time)
[announced in June 2019](https://blog.aboutamazon.com/transportation/a-drone-program-taking-flight)
the technology is ready, but still needs operationalization including e.g. regulatory approval.}

\notes{
> When we announced earlier this year that we were evolving our Prime
> two-day shipping offer in the U.S. to a one-day program, the
> response was terrific. But we know customers are always looking for
> something better, more convenient, and there may be times when
> one-day delivery may not be the right choice. Can we deliver
> packages to customers even faster? We think the answer is yes, and
> one way we’re pursuing that goal is by pioneering autonomous drone
> technology.

\notes{
> Today at Amazon’s re:MARS Conference (Machine Learning, Automation,
> Robotics and Space) in Las Vegas, we unveiled our latest Prime Air
> drone design. We’ve been hard at work building fully electric drones
> that can fly up to 15 miles and deliver packages under five pounds
> to customers in less than 30 minutes. And, with the help of our
> world-class fulfillment and delivery network, we expect to scale
> Prime Air both quickly and efficiently, delivering packages via
> drone to customers within months.
}

\notes{The 15 miles in less than 30 minutes implies air speed velocities of around 50 kilometers per hour.} 

\notes{
> Our newest drone design includes advances in efficiency, stability
> and, most importantly, in safety. It is also unique, and it advances
> the state of the art. How so? First, it’s a hybrid design. It can do
> vertical takeoffs and landings – like a helicopter. And it’s
> efficient and aerodynamic—like an airplane. It also easily
> transitions between these two modes—from vertical-mode to airplane
> mode, and back to vertical mode.
}

\notes{
> It’s fully shrouded for safety. The shrouds are also the wings,
> which makes it efficient in flight.
