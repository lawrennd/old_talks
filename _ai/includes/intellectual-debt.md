\subsection{Lean Startup Methodology}

\notes{In technology, there is the notion of a "minimum viable product" (MVP).
Sometimes called "minimum loveable product" (MLP). A minimum viable
product is the smallest thing that you need to ship to test your
commercial idea. There is a methodology known as the "lean start-up"
methodology, where you use the least effort to create your machine
learning model is deployed.

The idea is that you should build the quickest thing possible to test
your market and see if your idea works. Only when you know your idea is
working should you invest more time and personnel in the software.

Unfortunately, there is a tension between deploying quickly and
deploying a maintainable system. To build an MVP you deploy quickly, but
if the system is successful you take a 'maintenance hit' in the future
because you've not invested early in the right maintainable design for
your system.

You save on engineer time at the beginning, but you pay it back with
high interest when you need a much higher operations load once the
system is deployed.

The notion of the Sculley paper is that there are particular challenges
for machine learning models around technical debt.}
