\notes{Early AI used expert systems: a set of logical rules implemented to reconstruct expertise. For example, rules to decide whether or not someone has cancer. Rule based systems are very hard to specify for complex processes.[^originai] 

[^originai]: GOFAI has its origins in the birth of computer science so it is unsurprising that logic should be the dominant paradigm. There was also a sense in which pure logic felt like it mapped well on to human reasoning. In practice, for any complex real world situation, the number of logical rules required causes an explosion in the *state space* of the system. This makes logical systems intractable in many applications.

* Can split applications of machine learning broadly into *data science* and *artificial intelligence*.
* *Data science*: making sense of 'new data', the large volumes of data from sensors and increased interconnectivity (big data, IoT)
* Classical statistics: the question is formed first, and data is later.
