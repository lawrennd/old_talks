\notes{Machine learning is the principal technology underlying the recent advances in artificial intelligence techniques. It is a fundamentally different approach to that developed in classical artificial intelligence (sometimes referred to as "good old fashioned AI" or GOFAI). GOFAI relied on symbolic logic as its mathematical engine.

* Early AI was expert systems.

\notes{Early AI used expert systems: a set of logical rules implemented to reconstruct expertise. For example, rules to decide whether or not someone has cancer. Rule based systems are very hard to specify for complex processes.[^originai] 

[^originai]: GOFAI has its origins in the birth of computer science so it is unsurprising that logic should be the dominant paradigm. There was also a sense in which pure logic felt like it mapped well on to human reasoning. In practice, for any complex real world situation, the number of logical rules required causes an explosion in the *state space* of the system. This makes logical systems intractable in many applications.

\subsection{Data Science}
\slides{
* ML has influenced *data science* and *artificial intelligence*.
* *Data science*: making sense of 'new data', large volumes from IoT etc.
* Classical statistics: question is first, data is later.

\notes{Can split applications of machine learning broadly into *data science* and *artificial intelligence*. *Data science*: making sense of 'new data', the large volumes of data from sensors and increased interconnectivity (big data, IoT). Classical statistics: the question is formed first, and data is later.}

\subsection{Artificial Intelligence}
\slides{
* *Artificial intelligence* originates in *cybernetics*
* Recreate 'intelligent' behaviour.
* Either *general intelligence* or emulate *human* capabilities.
}
\notes{In contrast, *Artificial intelligence* originates in *cybernetics*. It is the challenge of recreating 'intelligent' behaviour. In some cases it can mean  *general intelligence* or emulation of *human* capabilities. Machine learning is important because of success of data-driven artificial intelligence. Data-driven artificial intelligence: instead of solving from first principles, collect data.}
