\notes{A second intervention is dealing with the complexity of the software systems that underpin modern AI solutions. Even if two individuals, say African masters students, who are technically capable and have an interesting idea, deploy their idea. One challenge they face is the operational load in *maintaining* and *explaining* their software systems. The challenge of *maintaining* is known as intellectual debt [@Sculley:debt15], the problem of *explaining* is known as [intellectual debt](https://medium.com/berkman-klein-center/from-technical-debt-to-intellectual-debt-in-ai-e05ac56a502c).}

\notes{The [AutoAI project](https://mlatcl.github.io/projects/autoai.html), sponsored by an ATI Senior AI Fellowship addresses this challenge.}
