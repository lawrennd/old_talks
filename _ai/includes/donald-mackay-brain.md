\notes{Donald MacKay was a physicist who worked on naval gun targetting during the second world war. The challenge with gun targetting for ships is that both the target and the gun platform are moving. The challenge was tackled using analogue computers, for example in the US the [Mark I fire control computer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_I_Fire_Control_Computer) which was a mechanical computer. MacKay worked on radar systems for gun laying, here the velocity and distance of the target could be assessed through radar and an mechanical electrical analogue computer.}

\notes{Donald MacKay was at King's College for his PhD. He was just down the road from Bill Phillips at LSE who was building the MONIAC. He was part of the Ratio Club. \ifndef{theRatioClub} A group of early career scientists who were interested in communication and control in animals and humans, or more specifically they were interested in computers and brains. The were part of an international movement known as cybernetics.\endif}

\notes{Donald MacKay wrote of the influence that his own work on radar had on
his interest in the brain.

\notes{Importantly, MacKay distinguishes between the *analogue*
computer and the *digital* computer. As he mentions, his experience
was with analogue machines. An analogue machine is *literally* an
analogue. The radar systems that Wiener and MacKay both worked on were
made up of electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, inductors and/or  mechanical components such as cams and gears. Together these components could represent a physical system, such as an
anti-aircraft gun and a plane. The design of the analogue computer
required the engineer to simulate the real world in analogue
electronics, using dualities that exist between e.g. mechanical
circuits (mass, spring, damper) and electronic circuits (inductor,
resistor, capacitor). The analogy between mass and a damper, between
spring and a resistor and between capacitor and a damper works because
the underlying mathematics is approximated with the same linear
system: a second order differential equation. This mathematical
analogy allowed the designer to map from the real world, through
mathematics, to a virtual world where the components reflected the
real world through analogy.}
