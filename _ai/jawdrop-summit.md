title: "Panel 2: AI for Good Business: Using Information Better and More Responsibly"
abstract: >
  The rapid advances of AI and ML are now embedded  in many aspects of human life. Discussions of the ethical implications have lagged behind the rapid pace of the technological advances and unintended consequences are only now beginning to unfold. 

  The panel addressed questions such as how we can harness explainable AI, mitigate for human biases in the data collection or analysis and use privacy-preserving algorithms to use AI and ML towards a fairer and more equitable world.
