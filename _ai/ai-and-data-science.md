title: "AI and Data Science"
subtitle: "Systems, Data Science, Biology, Medicine"
venue: "Autumn Data Science School, Cambridge"
abstract: >
  Waves of automation have driven human advance, and each wave requires humans to The promise of AI is to launch new systems of automated intellectual endeavour that will be the first systems to adapt to us. 
  
  In reality, the systems we have will not achieve this, and it is the biological sciences that teach us this lesson most starkly. 
  
  In this talk I will review some of the successes and challenges of AI and its deployment and propose practical visions for the future based on approaches that have worked in the past.
