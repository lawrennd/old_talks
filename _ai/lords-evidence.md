  The Communications and Digital Committee is launching an inquiry
  that will examine large language models and what needs to happen
  over the next 1–3 years to ensure the UK can respond to their

  Government and regulators, examining how well this addresses current
  and future technological capabilities, and reviewing the
  implications of approaches taken elsewhere in the world.
