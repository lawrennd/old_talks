title: "AI Can’t Fix This: Happenstance Data, Modelling, and the Covid19 PandemicPolicy, Science and the Convening Power of Data"
abstract: |
  With the world watching case numbers increase and publics and
  policymakers scrutinising projections from epidemiological models,
  the covid-19 pandemic brought with it increased attention on the use
  of data to inform policy. Alongside this scrutiny came a new wave of
  interest in the ability of data and artificial intelligence (AI) to
  help tackle major scientific and social challenges: could our
  increasing ability to collect, combine and interrogate large
  datasets lead to new insights that unlock more effective policy
  responses? Experiences from the DELVE Initiative, convened to bring
  data science to bear on covid-19 policy, suggests achieving this aim
  requires wider adoption of open data science methods to deploy data
  science and AI expertise and resources to tackle real-world
  problems.

\notes{There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but we’re still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed on some of the foundational issues around data use – access, skills, culture – before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI. [link here to data readiness]}

\notes{Delivering a rapid response requires the ability to quickly convene teams from across disciplines (and often institutions) around a key question. To facilitate this, we also used ideas from \addblog{open data science}{2014/07/01/open-data-science} to facilitate communication and understanding.}

\notes{The particular circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted the challenges of integrating scientific ideas to answer policy questions. In this talk, we've given a formal introduction to the problem, the difficulty of communicating between individuals (particularly from different domains) and reviewed the ideas and solutions we used in the Delve initiative.}

\notes{Recommendations from the DELVE Data report suggest that more effort needs to be placed into working in this manner in normal circumstances, so that when an emergency occurs we are better prepared to deal with the questions we face.}

\notes{When we combine these difficult challenges with complex models, we need to put more effort into decomposing our models so that they may be calibrated and re-integrated at appropriate fidelities.}
