\subsection{Example: Prediction of Malaria Incidence in Uganda}

\centerdiv{\martinMubangiziPicture{15%}\ricardoAndradePachecoPicture{15%}\johnQuinnPicture{15%}}

\notes{As an example of using Gaussian process models within the full pipeline from data to decsion, we'll consider the prediction of Malaria incidence in Uganda. For the purposes of this study malaria reports come in two forms, HMIS reports from health centres and Sentinel data, which is curated by the WHO. There are limited sentinel sites and many HMIS sites.

The work is from Ricardo Andrade Pacheco's PhD thesis, completed in collaboration with John Quinn and Martin Mubangizi [@Andrade:consistent14;@Mubangizi:malaria14]. John and Martin were initally from the AI-DEV group from the University of Makerere in Kampala and more latterly they were based at UN Global Pulse in Kampala. You can see the work summarized on the UN Global Pulse [disease outbreaks project site here](https://diseaseoutbreaks.unglobalpulse.net/uganda/).}

\notes{Malaria data is spatial data. Uganda is split into districts, and health reports can be found for each district. This suggests that models such as conditional random fields could be used for spatial modelling, but there are two complexities with this. First of all, occasionally districts split into two. Secondly, sentinel sites are a specific location within a district, such as Nagongera which is a sentinel site based in the Tororo district.}

\notes{The common standard for collecting health data on the African continent is from the Health management information systems (HMIS). However, this data suffers from missing values [@Gething:hmis06] and diagnosis of diseases like typhoid and malaria may be confounded.}

\notes{[World Health Organization Sentinel Surveillance systems](https://www.who.int/immunization/monitoring_surveillance/burden/vpd/surveillance_type/sentinel/en/) are set up "when high-quality data are needed about a particular disease that cannot be obtained through a passive system". Several sentinel sites give accurate assessment of malaria disease levels in Uganda, including a site in Nagongera.}

\notes{In collaboration with the AI Research Group at Makerere we chose to investigate whether Gaussian process models could be used to assimilate information from these two different sources of disease informaton. Further, we were interested in whether local information on rainfall and temperature could be used to improve malaria estimates.}

\notes{The aim of the project was to use WHO Sentinel sites, alongside rainfall and temperature, to improve predictions from HMIS data of levels of malaria.}

\notes{Health monitoring system for the Kabarole district. Here we have fitted the reports with a Gaussian process with an additive covariance function. It has two components, one is a long time scale component (in red above) the other is a short time scale component (in blue).}

\notes{Monitoring proceeds by considering two aspects of the curve. Is the blue line (the short term report signal) above the red (which represents the long term trend? If so we have higher than expected reports. If this is the case *and* the gradient is still positive (i.e. reports are going up) we encode this with a *red* color. If it is the case and the gradient of the blue line is negative (i.e. reports are going down) we encode this with an *amber* color. Conversely, if the blue line is below the red *and* decreasing, we color *green*. On the other hand if it is below red but increasing, we color *yellow*.}

\notes{This gives us an early warning system for disease. Red is a bad situation getting worse, amber is bad, but improving. Green is good and getting better and yellow good but degrading.}

\notes{Finally, there is a gray region which represents when the scale of the effect is small.}
