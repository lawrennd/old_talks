\subsection{UK Government Stipulation on Data Availability}

\notes{As far back as 2012 the UK government was stipulating that NHS records should be made available on line to patients. This seemed to herald a new era of patient understanding about their data.}

\notes{The reaction of the Royal College of General Practioners at the time was to say that the data that was accessible should be restricted. This raises interesting questions around what data should be made available to a doctor, but not to the individual patient it pertains to.}

    
\subsection{EMIS Patient Access}

\notes{The majority of general practioner patient data is held by two companies in the UK. EMIS and SystemOne. EMIS made their data available through a web portal, <patient.co.uk>.}

\notes{Simultaneously, the government at the time was stipulating that data access requests should become electronic. Allowing an ecosystem by which individuals could trigger access to their own data.}

\newslide{Botched}

\notes{When it came to the advantages that could be derived from the data, NHS dDigital proposed a opt-out system for sharing the data. This promised to deliver great benefits in terms of understanding disease. But the launch was botched. The limited scope for opting in and out of the scheme, added to a lack of a clear vision around whether the data was for sale or for health, undermined the confidence of the public. This set back the availability of health data for a number of years.}

\notes{More recently, the health services are taking a more mature view of data and its utility in aiding an aging population. The Topol review is a recent report in to how the NHS can benefit from the data revolution.}
