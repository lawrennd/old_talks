\notes{This data can take many forms, and may only be weakly informative. For example, what does it tell us about an individual's heart disease risk if we discover they have easy access to cheap bacon buttys. Anything or nothing? What if they regularly interact with a supplier of buttys on social media. There is the potential to build up a picture of the individual that may be biased or informative. Beyond social network data, there is music listening habits, exercise habits.}
