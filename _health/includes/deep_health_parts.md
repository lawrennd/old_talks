### What Can Academics Do that Google Can’t?

-   Google’s resources give them access to volumes of data (or Facebook,
    or Microsoft, or Amazon).

-   Is there anything for Universities to contribute?

-   Assimilation of multiple views of the patient: each perhaps from a
    different patient.

-   This may be done by small companies (with support of Universities).

-   A Facebook app for your personalised health.

-   These methodologies are part of that picture.
