\subsection{What's Changed (Changing) for Medical Data?}

\slides{* Genotyping.
* Epigenotyping.
* Transcriptome.
* Detailed characterization of phenotype.
    * Stratification of patients.
* Massive unstructured data sources.}

\notes{In medical data we now receive a diversity of different perspetives on the individual human. From individual genotyping, to epigenotyping. The transcriptome of the cells. The detailed chracterization of the phenotype. All of this information enables us to stratify patients to a greater degree, potentially targeting better mechanisms towards them.

The challenge is in the massive unstructured data sources we need to pull together to exploit this information.}
