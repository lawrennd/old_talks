\subsection{Summary}

* Intention is to deploy probabilistic machine learning for assimilating a wide range of data types in personalized health:
  * Social networking, text (clinical notes), survival times, medical imaging, phenotype, genotype, mobile phone records, music tastes, Tesco club card
* Requires population scale models with millions of features. 
* May be necessary for early detection of dementia or other diseases with high noise to signal.
* Major issues in privacy and interfacing with the patient.
* But: the revolution \emph{is} coming. We need to steer it.
