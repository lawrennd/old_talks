\subsection{Awareness}

* Need to increase awareness of the pitfalls among researchers
* Need to ensure that technological solutions are being delivered not merely for few (#FirstWorldProblems)
* Address a wider set of challenges that the greater part of the world's population is facing

\subsection{Conclusion}

* Data science offers a great deal of promise for personalized health
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them
* Need new ways of thinking! 
* *Mathematical* Data Science

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**
