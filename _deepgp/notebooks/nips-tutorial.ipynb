    "Despite the different role of model and algorithm, the two concepts are often conflated. This sometimes leads to a confused discussion. I was recently asked \"Is it correct to remove the mean from the data before you do principal component analysis.\" This question is about an algorithmic procedure, but the correct answer depends on what modelling assumption you are seeking to make when you are constructing your principal component analysis. Principal component analysis was originally proposed by  a *model* for data by <cite nodata-cite=\"Hotelling:analysis33\">Hotelling (1933)</cite>. It is a latent variable model that was directly inspired by work in the social sciences on factor analysis. However, much of our discussion of PCA today focusses on PCA as an algorithm. The algorithm for fitting the PCA model is to seek the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix, and people often refer to this algorithm as principal component analysis. However, that algorithm also finds the linear directions of maximum variance in the data. Seeking directions of maximum variance in the data was not the objective of Hotelling, but it is related to a challenge posed by <cite nodata-cite=\"Pearson:01\">Pearson (1901)</cite> who sought a variant of regression that predicted symmetrically regardless of which variable was considered to be the covariate and which variable the response. Coincidentally the algorithm for this model is also the eigenvector decomposition of the covariance matrix. However, the underlying model is different. The difference becomes clear when you begin to seek non-linear variants of principal component analysis. Depending on your interpretation (finding directions of maximum variance in the data or a latent variable model) the corresponding algorithm differs. For the Pearson model a valid non-linearization is kernel PCA <cite nodata-cite=\"Schoelkopf:\">(Schoelkopf et al, 1999)</cite>, but for the Hotelling model this generalization doesn't make sense. A valid generalization of the Hotelling model is provided by the Gaussian process latent variable model <cite nodata-cite=\"Lawrence:pnpca05\">(Lawrence, 2005)</cite>. This confusion is often unhelpful, so for the moment we will leave algorithmic considerations to one side and focus *only* on the model. "

For a full perspective on a patient's health, this data would need to be combined with more traditional sources phenotype and genotyp infomration. For example, high resolution scans of the genome providing a detailed characterization of genotype. Large scale gene expression measurements, giving detailed insights into phenotype at the cellular level. Images containing x-rays or biopsies. Doctor's notes, but handwritten and those that encode a diangosis. Clinical tests, for example in cardiovascular disease cholestorol level.

    "For applications like the personalized health monitoring system described above, we need a model that will give well calibrated predictions from the first day of it being brought on line, and throughout its operational life. If the model is complex enough to represent the full spectrum of possible human ailments, then when the model is first brought on stream,  it is unlikely to have sufficient data to determine the parameters. In the standard modeling framework we are faced with the bias variance dilema <cite data-cite=\\\"Geman:bias92\\\">(Geman et al, 1992)</cite>. If the model is complex enough to represent the underlying data structure, the parameters will be badly determined for small, or badly designed data sets, and the model will exhibit a large error due to variance. A traditional solution is to err towards bias, by constructing a simpler model, but one where the parameters can be well determined by the data, we reduce variance at the expense of some bias. In the context of our medical application, there are three major problems with this approach. Firstly, the size and scope of the data is continually evolving: we do not have a fixed design. This means that even if we were to find a good initial compromise between bias and variance, this compromise may be rapidly invalidated. Secondly, the compromise we find would have to apply equally to all patients despite the diversity of data we have associated with those patients. Finally, we should fear the confidence of predictions from a model with well determined parameters unless we truly believe we have sufficient data to capture some underlying deterministic truth. Medical outcome is laced with uncertainty, and this uncertainty needs to be modeled correctly because its structure has a significant effect on treatment. "

If all parameters are well determined, then our assumption of statistical independence becomes a strong one: the residual uncertainty is only in the noise, which by its independent nature, is impossible to model. However, any uncertainty in the parameters gives a much more structured uncertainty distribution for the data."

One approach to this problem is to build models in which the parameters are well determined. For teh independence across data points case, this involves having many observations (large $\\numData$) relative to the number of parameters (which often scales with $\\dataDim$). This motivates the issues of the large $\\dataDim$ small $\\numData$ domain, where the conditions are reversed. Of course, from a modelling perspective this issue is trivially solved by assuming independence across the $\\dataDim$ data dimensions and allowing the parameters to scale with the number of data $\\numData$. This is a characteristic exhibited, for example by the Gaussian process latent variable model <cite data-cite=\"Lawrence:pnpca05\">(Lawrence, 2005)</cite> which in standard form assumes independence arcross $\\dataDim$ for high dimensional data and associates each data point with a latent variable that is treated as a parameter. In <cite data-cite=\"Lawrence:unifying12\">Lawrence (2010)</cite> we argued that the succesful class of *spectral* approaches to dimensionality reduction (e.g. <cite data-cite=\"Roweis:lle00\">LLE, Roweis and Saul 2001</cite> and <cite data-cite=\"Weinberger:learning04\">maximum variance unfolding, Weinberger et al, 2004</cite>), which are widely applied in the large $\\dataDim$ small $\\numData$ domain, also have a probabilistic intepretation where the underlying likelihood factorizes across data dimensions. Regardless of our choice of factorization though, we are still making the same claim: a particular vector, or matrix, of parameters is suffcient for us to consider that the data independent, either across features or data points.

I believe it stems from the origin of the field of statistics, where the intention was to make a strong scientific claim based on numbers take from a *table* of data. A table naturally lends itself towards a matrix form. In these data a statistical design normally involved measuring a fixed number of *features* for a perhaps variable number of *items*. The objective is to find sufficient number of items so that you can make strong claims about which features are important. For example, does smoking correlate with lung cancer?

Contrast this situation with that traditionally faced in missing data where a table of values, $\\dataMatrix$, might have 10%-50% of the measurements missing, perhaps due to problems in data collection.

Graphical models normally express the conditional independence relationships in the data, with this graph we are not a priori considering any such relationships.

But the characteristic of massive missing data is particularly obvious when we look at clinical domains. EMIS, a Yorkshire based provider of software to General Practitioners, has 39 million patient records. When we consider clinical measurements, we need to build models that not only take into account all current clinical tests, but all tests that will be invented in the future. This leads to the idea of massive missing data. The classical statistical table of data is merely the special case where someone has filled in a block of information. "

    "To deal with massively missing data we need to think about the *Kolmogorov consistency* of a process. Let me introduce Kolmogorov consistency by way of an example heard from Tony O'Hagan, but one that he credits originally to Michael Goldstein. Imagine you are on jury duty. You are asked to adjudicate on the guilt or innocence of Lord Safebury, and you are going to base your judgement on a model that is weighing all the evidence. You are just about to pronounce your decision when a maid comes running in and shouts \"He didn't do it! He didn't do it!\". The maid wasn't on the witness list and isn't accounted for in your model. How does this effect your inference? The pragmatists answer might be: not at all, because the maid wasn't in the model. But in the interests of justice we might want to include this information in our inference process. If, as a result of the maid's entry, we now think it is less likely that Lord Safebury committed the crime, then necessarily every time that the (unannounced) maid doesn't enter the room we have to assume that it is more likely that Safebury commited the crime (to ensure that the conditional probability of guilt given the maid's evidence normalizes. But we didn't know about the maid, so how can we account for this? Further, how can we account for all possible other surprise evidence, from the announced butlers, gardners, chauffeurs and footmen? Kolmogorov consistency says that the net effect of marginalizing for all these potential bits of new information is null. It is a particular property of the model. Making it (only slightly) more formal, we can consider Kolmogorov consistency as a marginalization property of the model. We take the $\\numData$ dimensional vector, $\\dataVector$, to be an (indexed) vector of all our instantiated observations of the world that we have *at the current time*. Then we take the $\\numData^*$ dimensional vector, $\\dataVector^*$ to be the observations of the world that we are *yet to see*. From the sum rule of probability we have"

So in other words $p(\\dataVector|\\numData*)=p(\\dataVector)$.

This is what this independence assumption implies.

The communication between the training data and the test data is like an information channel. This TT channel has a bandwidth that is restricted by our choice of the dimensionality of $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ at *design* time. This seems foolish. Better to ensure we choose a model that allows for that channel to be potentially infinite. This implies a non-parametric approach. Our prior over $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ should be *non parametric*."

By non-parametric we are proposing using classes of models for which the conditional distribution, $p(\\dataVector^*|\\dataVector)$ is not decomposable into the expectation of $p(\\dataVector^*|\\paramVector)$ under the posterior distribution of the parameters, $p(\\paramVector|\\dataVector)$ for any fixed length parameter vector $\\paramVector$. We don't want to impose such a strong constraint on our model at *design time*. Our model may be required to be operational for many years and the true complexity of the system being modeled may not even be well understood at *design time*. We must turn to paradigms that allow us to be adaptable at *run time*. Non parametrics provides just such a paradigm, because the effect parameter vector increases in size as we observe more data.

    "Human beings, despite are large, interconnected brains, only have finite storage. Similar for digital computers. So we need to assume that we can only store a finite number of things about the data $\\dataVector$. This seems to push us back towards non-parametric models. Here, though, we choose to go a different way. We choose to introduce a set of auxiliary variables, $\\inducingVector$, which are $\\numInducing$ in length. Rather than representing the non parametric density directly, we choose to focus on storing information about $\\inducingVector$. By storing information about these variables, rather than storing all the data $\\dataVector$ we hope to get around this problem. In order for us to be non parametric about our predictions for $\\dataVector*$ we must condition on all the data, $\\dataVector$. We can't any longer store an intermediate distribution to represent our sum knowlege, $p(\\paramVector|\\dataVector)$. Such an intermediate distribution is a finite dimensional object, and non-parametrics implies that we cannot store all the information in a finite dimensional distribution. This presents a problem for real systems in practice. We are now faced with a compromise, how can we have a distribution which is flexible enough to respond at *run time* to unforeseen complexity in the training data? Yet, simultaneously doesn't require unbounded storage to retain all the information in the training data? We will now introduce a perspective on variational inference that will allow us to retain the advantages of both worlds. We will construct a parametric approximation to the true non-parametric conditional distribution. But, importantly, whilst this parametric approximation will suffer from the constraints on the bandwidth of the TT channel that drove us to non-parametric models in the first place, we will be able to change the number of parameters at *run time* not simply at design time."

In other words, it is very similar to the parametric approach, but now we have access to a future pool of additional parameters, $\\inducingVector^*$ that we can call upon to increase the bandwidth of the TT channel as appropriate. In parametric modelling, calling upon such parameters has a significant effect on the likelihood of the model, but here these variables are auxiliary variables that will *not* effect the likelihood of the model. They merely effect our ability to approximate the true bandwidth of the TT channel. The quality of this approximation can be varied at run time. It is not necessary to specify it at design time.

The idea of the fundamental variables is that they are sufficient to describe the world around us, but we might not be able to observe them directly. In particular we might observe relatively simple corruptions of the fundamental variables such as independent addition of noise, or thresholding. We might observe something relative about two fundamental veriables. For example if we took $\\mappingFunction_12,345$ to be the height of Tom Cruise and $\\mappingFunction_23,789$ to be the height of Penelope Cruz then we might take for an observation a binary value indicating the relative heights, so $\\datascalar_72,394 = \\mappingFunction_12,345 < \\mappingFunction_23,789$. The fundamental variable is an artificial construct, but it can prove to be a useful one. In particular we'd like to assume that the relationship between our observations, $\\dataVector$ and the fundamental variables, $\\mappingFunctionVector$ might factorize in some way. In the framework we think of this relationship, given by $p(\\dataVector|\\inducingVector)$ as the *likelihood*. We can ensure that assuming the likelihood factorizes does not at all reduce the generality of our model, by forcing the distribution over the fundamentals, $p(\\mappingFunctionVector)$ to also be Kolmogorov consistent. This ensures that in the case where the the likelihood is fully factorized over $\\numData$ the model is still general if we allow the factors of the likelihood to be Dirac delta functions  suggesing that $\\dataScalar_i = \\mappingFunction_i$.

In effect we have multivariate indices to account for the full provenance, so that our observations of the world are given as a function of, for example, the when, the where and the what. When is given by time, where is given by spatial location and what is given by a (potentially discrete) index indicating the further provenance of the data.

There are many occasions when it is useful to include a mean function, but normally the mean function will have a parametric form, $m(\\inputVector;\\paramVector)$, and be subject (in itself) to the same constraints that a standard parametric model has. Indeed, if we choose to model a function as a parametric form plus Gaussian noise, we can recast such a model as a simple Gaussian process with a covariance function $k_\\mappingFunction(\\inputVector_i,\\inputVector_j) = \\dataStd^2 \\delta_{i, j}$, where $\\delta_{i, j}$ is the *Kronecker* delta-function and a mean function that is given by the standard parametric form. In this case we see that the covariance function is mopping up the *residuals* that are not captured by the mean function. If we genuinely were interested in the form of a parametric mean function, as we often are in statistics, where the mean function may include a set of covariates and potential effects, often denoted by"

In this case the particular influence of each of the covariates is being encoded in a vector $\\boldsymbol{\\beta}$. To a statistician, the relative values of the elements of this vector are often important in making a judgement about the influence of the covariates.  For example, in disease modelling the mean function might be used in a *generalised* linear model through a link function to represent a rate or risk of disease \\citep{Diggle:somewhere}. The covariates should *co-vary* (or move together) with the response variable. Appropriate covariates for malaria incidence rate might include known influencers of the disease. For example if we are dealing with *malaria* then we might expect disease rates to be influenced by altitude, average temperature, average rainfall, local distribution of prophylactic measures (such as nets) etc. The covariance of the Gaussian process then has the role of taking care of the *residual* variance in the data: the data that is not explained by the mean function, i.e. the variance that cannot be explained by the parametric model. In a disease mapping model it makes sense to assume that these residuals may not be independent. An underestimate of disease at one spatial location, may imply an underestimate of disease rates at a nearby location. The mismatch between the observed disease rate and that predicted by modeling the relationship with the covariates through the mean function is then given by the covariance function."

    "The modeling philosophy in machine learning is somewhat different from that followed in traditional statistics. In machine learning the aim is often to be predictive, rather than explanatory. There is typically less need for an interpretable model, and so the mean function is much less rarely used. The objective is to predict the data entirely through the covariance function. From the arguments we developed earlier about the need for nonparametrics this makes a lot of sense. In particular if we rely on the mean function to make our predictions and assume that the covariance function is dealing with the residuals, then as we obtain more data the parameters of the mean function will become better determined. If the mean function does capture the majority of the variance of our observations, then the role of the covariance function will be reduced to capture only the variance of the residuals. But at this point we are left with a model that is dominated by is parametric part at the expense of its non parametric part. If the parameters have become well determined then the uncertainty about future predictions will be reduced. However, if we enter a novel domain (one where the provenance of the data differs significantly from the data we observed at training time) then we will still make very confident extrapolations when predicting for the new data. For this reason in machine learning we often prefer to leave out the mean function to ensure that the signal variance is explained through non parametric part of the model rather than the parametric mean function. In what follows we will drop the mean function and focus only on the covariance function."
