title: "Deep Gaussian Processes: A Motivation and Introduction"
abstract: >
  Modern machine learning methods have driven significant advances in
  artificial intelligence, with notable examples coming from Deep
  Learning, enabling super-human performance in the game of Go and
  highly accurate prediction of protein folding e.g. AlphaFold. In
  this talk we look at deep learning from the perspective of Gaussian
  processes. Deep Gaussian processes extend the notion of deep
  learning to propagate uncertainty alongside function values. Weâ€™ll
  explain why this is important and show some simple examples.
