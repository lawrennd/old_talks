\subsection{A University Computing Laboratory}

> In 1932 John Lennard-Jones, Professor of Theoretical Physics at
> Bristol University, was appointed to the John Humphrey Plummer Chair
> of Theoretical Chemistry at Cambridge University, which had become
> available thanks to a munificent bequest to the University of
> £200,000. In his new position Lennard-Jones continued the research
> he had started at Bristol University on the application of quantum
> mechanics to problems associated with chemistry. He and his students
> identified a number of problems that gave rise to complex equations
> which could only be solved by numerical methods.

\notes{The Department of Computer Science and Technology was set up in the
    1930s, when it was known as the Mathematical Laboratory. At that
    time ‘computer’ had a different meaning – a computer was a person
    employed to do numerical calculations by hand. But advances in
    mechanical systems looked promising.}

\notes{The case for creating the Lab, which was made in a report to the
    University in 1936, argued that:

-   Mechanical devices for performing calculations were developing
        (and human ‘computers’ were becoming harder to find).

-   A range of scientists from across disciplines were looking to
        make use of machines for numerical work.

-   But, despite their promise, the machines available at the time
        were unsuitable for some complex problems – tackling these would
        require better machines to be developed.

-   In response to these needs, the Lab was set up with the aim of
    enabling researchers to make use of new mechanical computers and
    developing more sophisticated machines to tackle complex problems.}
