\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/ai/Lancelot_fighting_the_dragons_of_the_Val_without_return}{60%}}{Lancelot quashing another software issue. Lancelot was Arthur's most trusted knight. In the software ecosystem the Lancelot figure is an old-hand software engineer who comes closest to having the full system overview. }{lancelot-software}

\notes{Eventually, a characteristic of the legacy system, is that changes
cannot be made without running them by Lancelot first. Initially this
isn't policy, but it becomes the de facto approach because leaders learn
that if Lancelot doesn't approve the change then the system fails.
Lancelot becomes a bottleneck for change, overloaded and eventually loses
track of where the system is.}
