\notes{However, when managing systems in production, you soon discover
maintenance of a rapidly deployed system is not your only problem.

To deploy large and complex software systems, an engineering approach
known as "separation of concerns" is taken. Frederick Brooks' book "The
Mythical Man-month" [@Brooks:mythical75], has itself gained almost
mythical status in the community. It focuses on what has become known as
Brooks' law "adding manpower to a late software project makes it later".

Adding people (men or women!) to a project delays it because of the
communication overhead required to get people up to speed.}
