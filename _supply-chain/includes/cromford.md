\subsection{Cromford}

\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/supply-chain/cromford-mill}{80%}}{Richard Arkwright is regarded of the founder of the modern factory system. Factories exploit distribution networks to centralize production of goods. Arkwright located his factory in Cromford due to proximity to Nottingham Weavers (his market) and availability of water power from the tributaries of the Derwent river. When he first arrived there was almost no transportation network. Over the following 200 years The Cromford Canal (1790s), a Turnpike (now the A6, 1816-18) and the High Peak Railway (now closed, 1820s) were all constructed to improve transportation access as the factory blossomed.}{cromford-mill}

\notes{Richard Arkwright is known as the father of the modern factory system. In 1771 he set up a [Mill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Mill) for spinning cotton yarn in the village of Cromford, in the Derwent Valley. The Derwent valley is relatively inaccessible. Raw cotton arrived in Liverpool from the US and India. It needed to be transported on packhorse across the bridleways of the Pennines. But Cromford was a good location due to proximity to Nottingham, where weavers where consuming the finished thread, and  the availability of water power from small tributaries of the Derwent river for Arkwright's [water frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_jenny) which automated the production of yarn from raw cotton.

By 1794 the [Cromford Canal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cromford_Canal) was opened to bring coal in to Cromford and give better transport to Nottingham. The construction of the canals was driven by the need to improve the transport infrastructure, facilitating the movement of goods across the UK. Canals, roads and railways were initially constructed by the economic need for moving goods. To improve supply chain.

The A6 now does pass through Cromford, but at the time he moved there there was merely a track. The High Peak Railway was opened in 1832, it is now converted to the High Peak Trail, but it remains the highest railway built in Britain.
