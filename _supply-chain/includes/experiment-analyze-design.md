\notes{One thing about working in an industrial environment, is the way that short term thinking actions become important. For example, in Formula One, the teams are working on a two week cycle to digest information from the previous week's race and incorporate updates to the car or their strategy. 

However, businesses have to also think about more medium term horizons. For example, in Formula 1 you need to worry about next year's car. So while you're working on updating this year's car, you also need to think about what will happen for next year and prioritise these conflicting needs appropriately. 

In the Amazon supply chain, there are the equivalent demands. If we accept that an artificial intelligence is just an automated decision making system. And if we measure in terms of money automatically spent, or goods automatically moved, then Amazon's buying system is perhaps the world's largest AI.

Those decisions are being made on short time schedules, purchases are made by the system on weekly cycles. But just as in Formula 1, there is also a need to think about what needs to be done next month, next quarter and next year. Planning meetings are held not only on a weekly basis (known as weekly business reviews), but monthly, quarterly and then yearly meetings for planning spends and investments.

Amazon is known for being longer term thinking than many companies, and a lot of this is coming from the CEO. One quote from Jeff Bezos that stuck with me was the following.}

\notes{
> “I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting question; it's a very common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change in the next 10 years?' And I submit to you that that second question is actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. ... [I]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices, and I know that's going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast delivery; they want vast selection. It's impossible to imagine a future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, 'Jeff I love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,' [or] 'I love Amazon; I just wish you'd deliver a little more slowly.' Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can afford to put a lot of energy into it.”

\notes{This quote is incredibly important for long term thinking. Indeed, it's a failure of many of our simulations that they focus on what is going to happen, not what will not happen. In Amazon, this meant that there was constant focus on these three areas, keeping costs low, making delivery fast and improving selection. For example, shortly before I left Amazon moved its entire US network from 2 day delivery to 1 day delivery. This involves changing the way the entire buying system operates. Or, more recently, the company has had to radically change the portfolio of products it buys in the face of Covid19.}

<!--These challenges are not just there for Amazon and Formula 1. In Sheffield, we worked closely with a Chesterfield based company called Fusion Group. They make joints that fuse PTFE pipes together. These pipes are used for transporting both water and gas. Their founder, Eric Bridgstock, was an engineer who introduced PTFE piping to the UK when working for DuPont. Eric set up Fusion group to manufacture the fusion fittings. Because PTFE pipes carry water or gas at high pressure, when these fittings fail significant damage can occur. When these fittings were originally installed in the early 1980s, the job was done by a specialist, but nowadays the pipe weld is compelted by the same team that digs the hole. While costs have come down, the number of PTFE weld failures went up. Eric's company focussed on new systems for auto-->

\notes{From the perspective of the team we had in the supply chain, we looked at what we most needed to focus on. Amazon moves very quickly, but we could also take a leaf out of Jeff's book, and instead of worrying about what was going to change, remember what wasn't going to change.}

> We don't know what science we'll want to do in 5 years time, but we won't want slower experiments, we won't want more expensive experiments and we won't want a narrower selection of experiments.

\notes{As a result, our focus was on how to speed up the process of experiments, increase the diversity of experiments that we can do, and keep the experiments price as low as possible.}

\notes{The faster the innovation fly-wheel can be iterated, then the quicker we can ask about different parts of the supply chain, and the better we can tailor systems to answering those questions.}
