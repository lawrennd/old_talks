\newslide{Motto}

\notes{So many examples in terms of the need for intelligent decision making are based around the challenge of moving goods/energy/compute/water/medicines/drivers/people from where it is to where it needs to be. In other words matching supply with demand. That led me to a motto I developed while working in Amazon's supply chain.}

> Solve Supply Chain, then solve everything else.
