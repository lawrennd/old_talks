\subsection{Supply Chain}

\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/supply-chain/packhorse-bridge-burbage-brook}{80%}}{Packhorse Bridge under Burbage Edge. This packhorse route climbs steeply out of Hathersage and heads towards Sheffield. Packhorses were the main route for transporting goods across the Peak District. The high cost of transport is one driver of the 'smith' model, where there is a local skilled person responsible for assembling or creating goods (e.g. a blacksmith). }{packhorse-bridge-burbage-brook}

\notes{On Sunday mornings in Sheffield, I often used to run across Packhorse Bridge in Burbage valley. The bridge is part of an ancient network of trails crossing the Pennines that, before Turnpike roads arrived in the 18th century, was the main way in which goods were moved. Given that the moors around Sheffield were home to sand quarries, tin mines, lead mines and the villages in the Derwent valley were known for nail and pin manufacture, this wasn't simply movement of agricultural goods, but it was the infrastructure for industrial transport.

The profession of leading the horses was known as a Jagger and leading out of the village of Hathersage is Jagger's Lane, a trail that headed underneath Stanage Edge and into Sheffield. 

The movement of goods from regions of supply to areas of demand is fundamental to our society. The physical infrastructure of supply chain has evolved a great deal over the last 300 years.}
