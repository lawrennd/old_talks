\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/supply-chain/container-2539942_1920}{80%}}{The container is one of the major drivers of globalization, and arguably the largest agent of social change in the last 100 years. It reduces the cost of transportation, significantly changing the appropriate topology of distribution networks. The container makes it possible to ship goods halfway around the world for cheaper than it costs to process those goods, leading to an extended distribution topology.}{container-2539942_1920}

\notes{Containerization has had a dramatic effect on global economics, placing many people in the developing world at the end of the supply chain. }

\notes{For example, you can buy Wild Alaskan Cod fished from Alaska, processed in China, sold in North America. This is driven by the low cost of transport for frozen cod vs the higher relative cost of cod processing in the US versus China.

\notes{This effect on cost of transport vs cost of processing is the main driver of the topology of the modern supply chain and the associated effect of globalization. If transport is much cheaper than processing, then processing will tend to agglomerate in places where processing costs can be minimized.}

\notes{Large scale global economic change has principally been driven by changes in the technology that drives supply chain.}
