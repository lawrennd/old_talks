\subsection{Imports, Installs, and Downloads}

First, we're going to download some particular python libraries for dealing with geospatial data. We're dowloading [```geopandas```](https://geopandas.org) which will help us deal with 'shape files' that give the geographical lay out of Nigeria. We also need ```pygeos``` for indexing.}

\ifeq{\databaseType}{sqlite}
\comment{And  to get a small database set up running quickly, we're installing [```csv-to-sqlite```](https://pypi.org/project/csv-to-sqlite/) which allows us to convert CSV data to a simple database.}
