\subsection{Linear Algebra, Probability and Differential Calculus}

We will be assuming that you have good background in maths. In
particular we will be making use of linear algrebra (matrix operations
including inverse, inner products, determinant etc), probability (sum
rule of probability, product rule of probability), and the calculus of
variation, e.g. differentiation and integration. A new concept for the
course is multivariate differentiation and integration. This combines
linear algebra and differential calculus. These techniques are vital
in understanding probability distributions over high dimensional
distributions.}
