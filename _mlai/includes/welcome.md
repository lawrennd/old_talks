\notes{Welcome to the Machine Learning and Adaptive
Intelligence course. In this course we will introduce the basic concepts of
machine learning and data science. In particular we will look at tools and
techniques that describe how to model. An integrated part of that is how we
approach data with the computer. We are choosing to do that with the tool you
see in front of you: the Jupyter Notebook.}

\notes{The notebook provides us with a way
of interacting with the data that allows us to give the computer instructions
and explore the nature of a data set. It is *different* to normal coding, but it
is related. In this course you will, through intensive practical sessions and
labs, develop your understanding of the interaction between data and computers.
The first thing we are going to do is ask you to forget a bit about what you
think about normal programming, or 'classical software engineering'. Classical
software engineering demands a large amount of design and testing. In data
analysis, testing remains very important, but the design is often evolving. The
design evolves through a process known as *exploratory data analysis*. You will
learn some of the techniques of exploratory data analysis in this course.}

\notes{A
particular difference between classical software engineering and data analysis
is the way in which programs are run. Classically we spend a deal of time
working with a text editor, writing code. Compilations are done on a regular
basis and aspects of the code are tested (perhaps with unit tests).}

\notes{Data
analysis is more like coding in a debugger. In a debugger (particularly a visual
debugger) you interact with the data stored in the memory of the computer to try
and understand what is happening in the computer, you need to understand exactly
what your bug is: you often have a fixed idea of what the program is trying to
do, you are just struggling to find out why it isn't doing it.}

\notes{Naturally,
debugging is an important part of data analysis also, but in some sense it can
be seen as its entire premise. You load in a data set into a computer that you
don't understand, your entire objective is to understand the data. This is best
done by interogating the data to visualise it or summarize it, just like in a
power visual debugger. However, for data science the requirements for
visualization and summarization are far greater than in a regular program. When
the data is well understood, the actual number of lines of your program may well
be very few (particularly if you disregard commands that load in the data and
commands which plot your results). If a powerful data science library is
available, you may be able to summarize your code with just two or three lines,
but the amount of intellectual energy that is expended on writing those three
lines is far greater than in standard code.}
