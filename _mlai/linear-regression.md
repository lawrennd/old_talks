title: Linear Algebra and Linear Regression
abstract: |
  In this session we combine the objective function perspective and the probabilistic perspective on *linear regression*. We motivate the importance of *linear algebra* by showing how much faster we can complete a linear regression using linear algebra.

\subsection{Review}

* Last time: Looked at objective functions for movie recommendation.
* Minimized sum of squares objective by steepest descent and stochastic gradients.
* This time: explore least squares for regression.
