title: "Generalization: Model Validation"
abstract: "Generalization is the main objective of a machine learning algorithm. The models we design should work on data they have not seen before. Confirming whether a model generalizes well or not is the domain of *model validation*. In this lecture we introduce approaches to model validation such as hold out validation and cross validation."

\subsection{Review}

* Last time: introduced basis functions.
* Showed how to maximize the likelihood of a non-linear model that's linear in parameters.
* Explored the different characteristics of different basis function models
