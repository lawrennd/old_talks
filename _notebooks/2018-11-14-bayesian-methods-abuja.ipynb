    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is making very simple assumptions about the data, in\n",
    "particular it is modeling the full *joint* probability of the data set,\n",
    "$p(\\dataVector, \\inputMatrix | \\paramVector, \\pi)$ by very strong\n",
    "assumptions about factorizations that are unlikely to be true in\n",
    "practice. The data conditional independence assumption is common, and\n",
    "relies on a rich parameter vector to absorb all the information in the\n",
    "training data. The additional assumption of naive Bayes is that features\n",
    "are conditional independent given the class label $\\dataScalar_i$ (and\n",
    "the parameter vector, $\\paramVector$. This is quite a strong assumption.\n",
    "However, it causes the objective function to decompose into parts which\n",
    "can be independently fitted to the different feature vectors, meaning it\n",
    "is very easy to fit the model to large data. It is also clear how we\n",
    "should handle *streaming* data and *missing* data. This means that the\n",
    "model can be run 'live', adapting parameters and information as it\n",
    "arrives. Indeed, the model is even capable of dealing with new\n",
    "*features* that might arrive at run time. Such is the strength of the\n",
    "modeling the joint probability density. However, the factorization\n",
    "assumption that allows us to do this efficiently is very strong and may\n",
    "lead to poor decision boundaries in practice.\n",
