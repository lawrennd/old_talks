    "The NIPS experiment was an experiment to determine the consistency of\n",
    "the review process. After receiving papers, we selected 10% that would\n",
    "be independently rereviewed. The idea was to determine how consistent\n",
    "the decisions between the two sets of independent papers would be. In\n",
    "2014 NIPS received 1678 submissions and we selected 170 for the\n",
    "experiment. These papers are referred to below as ‘duplicated papers.’\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the experiment, we created two separate committees within the\n",
    "NIPS program committee. The idea was that the two separate committees\n",
    "would review each duplicated paper independently and results compared.\n",

    "for dual reviewing. For these papers the program committee was divided\n",
    "into two. Reviewers were placed randomly on one side of the committee or\n",

    "There seems to have been a lot of discussion of the result, both at the conference and on bulletin boards since. Such discussion is to be encouraged, and for ease of memory, it is worth pointing out that the approximate proportions of papers in each category can be nicely divided in to eighths as follows. Accept-Accept 1 in 8 papers, Accept-Reject 3 in 8 papers, Reject-Reject, 5 in 8 papers. This makes the statistics we've computed above: inconsistency 1 in 4 (25%) accept precision 1 in 2 (50%) reject precision 5 in 6 (83%) and agreed accept rate of 1 in 6 (20%). This compares with the accept rate of 1 in 4.\n",

It therefore produces numbers that don't match ours above. This is because the computed accept rate of the individual committees is different from that of the main conference.

    "\n",
    "To get a handle on the uncertainty around these numbers we'll start by making use of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution\" target=\"_blank\">binomial distribution</a>. First, let's explore the fact that for the overall conference the accept rate was around 23%, but for the duplication committees the accept rate was around 25%. If we assume decisions are made according to a binomial distribution, then is the accept rate for the duplicated papers too high?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for all our accept probability statistics we used as a denominator the number of papers that were initially sent for review, rather than the number where a final decision was made by the program committee. These numbers are different because some papers are withdrawn before the program committee makes its decision. Most commonly this occurs after authors have seen their preliminary reviews: for NIPS 2014 we provided preliminary reviews that included paper scores. So for the official accept probability we use the 170 as denominator. The accept probabilities were therefore 43 out of 170 papers (25.3%) for Committee 1 and 44 out of 170 (25.8%) for Committee 2. This compares with the overall conference accept rate for papers outside the duplication process of 349 out of 1508 (23.1%).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the true underlying probability of an accept were 0.23, independent of the paper, then the probability of generating accepts for any subset of the papers would be given by a binomial distribution. Combining across the two committees for the duplicated papers, we see that 87 papers in total were recommended for accept out of a total of 340 trials. out of 166 trials would be given by a binomial distribution as depicted below.\n",

    "Those analyses don’t have access to information like paper scores etc.\n",
    "For that reason we also leave out such information in this preliminary\n",

    "how many papers were consistently accepted, consistently rejected, or\n",
    "had inconsistent decisions. For the moment we disregard the information\n",
    "we have about paper scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis there are three possible outcomes for each paper:\n",
    "consistent accept, inconsistent decision and consistent reject. So, we\n",
    "need to perform the analysis with the [multinomial\n",
    "distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution).\n",
    "The multinomial is parameterized by the probabilities of the different\n",
    "outcomes. These are our parameters of interest; we would like to\n",
    "estimate these probabilities alongside their uncertainties. To make a\n",
    "Bayesian analysis we place a prior density over these probabilities,\n",
    "then we update the prior with the observed data, that gives us a\n",
    "posterior density, giving us an uncertainty associated with these\n",
    "probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prior Density\n",
    "\n",
    "Choice of prior for the multinomial is typically straightforward, the\n",
    "[Dirichlet density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirichlet_distribution)\n",
    "is [conjugate](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior) and has the\n",

    "density only, then the approach is known as [Laplace\n",
    "smoothing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_smoothing).\n",
    "\n",
    "For our model we are assuming for our prior that the probabilities are\n",

    "inconsistent decision (outcome 2) or a consistent reject (outcome 3). If\n",

    "In this note book we deal with reviewer calibration. Our assumption is\n",
    "that the score from the $j$th reviwer for the $i$th paper is given by $$\n",
    "y_{i,j} = f_i + b_j + \\epsilon_{i, j}\n",
    "$$ where $f_i$ is the ‘objective quality’ of paper $i$ and $b_j$ is an\n",
    "offset associated with reviewer $j$. $\\epsilon_{i,j}$ is a subjective\n",
    "quality estimate which reflects how a specific reviewer’s opinion\n",
    "differs from other reviewers (such differences in opinion may be due to\n",
    "differing expertise or perspective). The underlying ‘objective quality’\n",
    "of the paper is assumed to be the same for all reviewers and the\n",
    "reviewer offset is assumed to be the same for all papers.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have $n$ papers and $m$ reviewers, then this implies $n$ + $m$ +\n",
    "$nm$ values need to be estimated. Naturally this is too many, and we can\n",
    "start by assuming that the subjective quality is drawn from a normal\n",
    "density with variance $\\sigma^2$ $$\n",
    "\\epsilon_{i, j} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2 \\mathbf{I})\n",
    "$$ which reduces us to $n$ + $m$ + 1 parameters. Further we can assume\n",
    "that the objective quality is also normally distributed with mean $\\mu$\n",
    "and variance $\\alpha_f$, $$\n",
    "f_i \\sim N(\\mu, \\alpha_f)\n",
    "$$ this now reduces us to $m$+3 parameters. However, we only have\n",
    "approximately $4m$ observations (4 papers per reviewer) so parameters\n",
    "may still not be that well determined (particularly for those reviewers\n",
    "that have only one review). We, therefore, finally, assume that reviewer\n",
    "offset is normally distributed with zero mean, $$\n",
    "b_j \\sim N(0, \\alpha_b),\n",
    "$$ leaving us only four parameters: $\\mu$, $\\sigma^2$, $\\alpha_f$ and\n",
    "$\\alpha_b$. Combined together these three assumptions imply that $$\n",
    "\\mathbf{y} \\sim N(\\mu \\mathbf{1}, \\mathbf{K}),\n",
    "$$ where $\\mathbf{y}$ is a vector of stacked scores $\\mathbf{1}$ is the\n",
    "vector of ones and the elements of the covariance function are given by\n",
    "$$\n",

    "$$ where $i$ and $j$ are the index of first paper and reviewer and $k$\n",
    "and $l$ are the index of second paper and reviewer. The mean is easily\n",
    "estimated by maximum likelihood and is given as the mean of all scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is convenient to reparametrize slightly into an overall scale\n",
    "$\\alpha_f$, and normalized variance parameters, $$\n",
    "k(i,j; k,l) = \\alpha_f\\left(\\delta_{i,k}  + \\delta_{j,l} \\frac{\\alpha_b}{\\alpha_f} + \\delta_{i, k}\\delta_{j,l} \\frac{\\sigma^2}{\\alpha_f}\\right)\n",
    "$$ which we rewrite to give two ratios: offset/signal ratio,\n",
    "$\\hat{\\alpha}_b$ and noise/signal $\\hat{\\sigma}^2$ ratio. $$\n",
    "k(i,j; k,l) = \\alpha_f\\left(\\delta_{i,k}  + \\delta_{j,l} \\hat{\\alpha}_b + \\delta_{i, k}\\delta_{j,l} \\hat{\\sigma}^2\\right)\n",
    "$$ The advantage of this parameterization is it allows us to optimize\n",
    "$\\alpha_f$ directly (with a fixed-point equation) and it will be very\n",
    "well determined. This leaves us with two free parameters, that we can\n",
    "explore on the grid. It is in these parameters that we expect the\n",
    "remaining underdetermindness of the model. We expect $\\alpha_f$ to be\n",
    "well determined because the negative log likelihood is now $$\n",
    "\\frac{|\\mathbf{y}|}{2}\\log\\alpha_f + \\frac{1}{2}\\log  \\left|\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}\\right| + \\frac{1}{2\\alpha_f}\\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y},\n",
    "$$ where $|\\mathbf{y}|$ is the length of $\\mathbf{y}$ (i.e. the number\n",
    "of reviews) and $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}=\\alpha_f^{-1}\\mathbf{K}$ is the scale\n",
    "normalized covariance. This negative log likelihood is easily minimized\n",
    "to recover $$\n",
    "\\alpha_f = \\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{y}|} \\mathbf{y}^\\top \\hat{\\mathbf{K}}^{-1} \\mathbf{y}.\n",
    "$$ A Bayesian analysis of this parameter is possible with gamma priors,\n",
    "but it would merely show that this parameter is extremely well\n",
    "determined (the degrees of freedom parameter of the associated\n",
    "Student-$t$ marginal likelihood scales will the number of reviews, which\n",
    "will be around $|\\mathbf{y}| \\approx 6,000$ in our case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we propose to proceed as follows. Set the mean from the reviews\n",
    "($\\mu$) and then choose a two-dimensional grid of parameters for\n",
    "reviewer offset and diversity. For each parameter choice, optimize to\n",
    "find $\\alpha_f$ and then evaluate the liklihood. Worst case this will\n",
    "require us inverting $\\hat{\\mathbf{K}}$, but if the reviewer paper\n",
