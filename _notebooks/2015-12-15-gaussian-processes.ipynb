    "characteristic of the model is speicified by a function that is liniear\n",

    "$$ where $\\mappingFunction(\\inputVector; \\mappingVector)$ is a\n",
    "linear-in-the-parameters function (here the parameters are\n",
    "$\\mappingVector$, which is generally non-linear in the inputs. So far we\n",
    "have considered basis function models of the form $$\n",
    "\\mappingFunction(\\inputVector) =\n",
    "\\mappingVector^\\top \\basisVector(\\inputVector).\n",
    "$$ When we form a Gaussian process we do something that is slightly more\n",

    "Models where we model the entire joint distribution of our training\n",
    "data, $p(\\dataVector, \\inputMatrix)$ are sometimes described as\n",
    "*generative models*. Because we can use sampling to generate data sets\n",

    "Gaussian processes are sometimes seen as part of a wider family of\n",

    "covariance functions, but in the field they are known as Mercer kernels.\n",
    "Mercer kernels have interpretations as inner products in potentially\n",
