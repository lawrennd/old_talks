    "\n",
    "$$\\text{data} + \\text{model} \\rightarrow \\text{prediction}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *data* is our observations. They can be actively or passively\n",
    "acquired (meta-data). The *model* contains our assumptions, based on\n",
    "previous experience. THat experience can be other data, it can come from\n",
    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
    "biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a categorization or\n",
    "a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay\n",
    "of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in\n",
    "artificial intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To\n",
    "combine data with a model we typically make use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a prediction function** a function which is used to make the\n",
    "predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the\n",
    "universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness,\n",
    "spatial similarities, temporal similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**an objective function** a function which defines the cost of\n",
    "misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world's\n",
    "generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for\n",
    "mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of data and model through the prediction function and\n",
    "the objectie function leads to a *learning algorithm*. The class of\n",
    "prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is\n",
    "restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or\n",
