    "prediction for perishable goods. Similarly, unsupervised learning can be\n",

    "These are certainly labels that can be provided by humans, but they were\n",

    "Unsupervised learning enables computers to form similar categorizations\n",
    "on data that is too large scale for us to process. When the Greek\n",

    "of the Platonic ideal. The Platonic ideal bird is the bird that is most\n",
    "bird-like or the chair that is most chair-like. In some sense, the task\n",
    "in clustering is to define different clusters, by finding their Platonic\n",
    "ideal (known as the cluster center) and allocate each data point to the\n",
    "relevant cluster center. So, allocate each animal to the class defined\n",
    "by its nearest cluster center.\n",
    "\n",
    "To perform clustering on a computer we need to define a notion of either\n",
    "similarity or distance between the objects and their Platonic ideal, the\n",

    "vectors of data, $\\inputVector_i$. Similarly, we represent our cluster\n",
    "center for category $j$ by a vector $\\meanVector_j$. This vector\n",
    "contains the ideal features of a bird, a chair, or whatever category $j$\n",
    "is. In clustering we can either think in terms of similarity of the\n",
    "objects, or distances. We want objects that are similar to each other to\n",
    "cluster together. We want objects that are distant from each other to\n",
    "cluster apart.\n",
    "\n",
    "This requires us to formalize our notion of similarity or distance.\n",
    "Let's focus on distances. A definition of distance between an object,\n",

    "Once we have decided on the distance or similarity function, we can\n",

    "## Game Play\n",
    "\n",
    "An area where reinforcement learning methods have been deployed with\n",
    "high profile success is game play. In game play the reward is delayed to\n",
    "the end of the game, and it comes in the form of victory or defeat. A\n",

    "through simulation of the game, it is possible to generate as much data\n",
    "as is required to solve the problem. For this reason, many of the recent\n",
    "advances in reinforcement learning have occurred with methods that are\n",
    "not data efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "The company DeepMind is set up around reinforcement learning as an\n",
    "approach to general intelligence. All their most well-known achievements\n",
    "are centered around artificial intelligence in game play. In\n",
    "reinforcement learning a decision made at any given time have a\n",
    "downstream effect on the result. Whether the effect if beneficial or not\n",
    "is unknown until a future moment.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of reinforcement learning as providing a label, but the\n",
    "label is associated with a series of data involving a number of\n",
    "decisions taken. Each decision was taken given the understanding of game\n",
    "play at any given moment. Understanding which of these decisions was\n",
    "important in victory or defeat is a hard problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "In machine learning the process of understanding which decisions were\n",
    "beneficial and which were detrimental is known as the credit allocation\n",
    "problem. You wish to reward decisions that led to success to encourage\n",
    "them, but punish decisions that lead to failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadly speaking, DeepMind uses an approach to Machine Learning where\n",
    "there are two mathematical functions at work. One determines the action\n",
    "to be taken at any given moment, the other estimates the quality of the\n",
    "board position at any given time. These are respectively known as the\n",
    "*policy network* and the *value network*.[^7] DeepMind made use of\n",
    "convolutional neural networks for both these models.\n",
    "\n",
    "## AlphaGo\n",
    "\n",
    "The ancient Chinese game of Go was considered a challenge for artificial\n",
    "intelligence for two reasons. Firstly, the game tree has a very high\n",
    "branching factor. The game tree is a discrete representation of the\n",
    "game. Every node in the game tree is associated with a board position.\n",
    "You can move through the game tree by making legal a move on the board\n",
    "to change the position. In Go, there are so many legal moves that the\n",
    "game tree increases exponentially. This challenge in Go was addressed by\n",
    "using stochastic game tree search. Rather than exploring the game tree\n",
    "exhaustively they explored it randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, evaluating the quality of any given board position was deemed\n",
    "to be very hard.[^8] The value function determines for each player\n",
    "whether they are winning or losing. Skilled Go players can assess a\n",
    "board position, but they do it by instinct, by intuition. Just as early\n",
    "AI researchers struggled to give rules for detecting cancer, it is\n",
    "challenging to give rules to assess a Go board. The machine learning\n",
    "approach that AlphaGo took is to train a value function network to make\n",
    "this assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach that DeepMind took to conquering Go is a *model-free*\n",
    "approach known as *Q-learning*.[^9] The model-free approach refers to\n",
    "the fact that they don't directly include a model of how the world\n",
    "evolves in the reinforcement learning algorithm. They make extensive use\n",
    "of the game tree, but they don't model how it evolves. They do model the\n",
    "expected reward of each position in the game tree (the value function)\n",
    "but that is not the same as modeling how the game will proceed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reinforcement Learning and Classical Control\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach to reinforcement learning is to use a prediction\n",
    "function to suggest how the world will evolve in response to your\n",
    "actions. To predict how the game tree will evolve. You can then use this\n",
    "prediction to indirectly infer the expected reward associated with any\n",
    "action. This is known as *model-based* reinforcement learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model-based approach is also closer to a control system. A\n",
    "classical control system is one where you give the system a set point.\n",
    "For example, a thermostat in the house. You set the temperature and the\n",
    "boiler switches off when it reaches it. Optimal control is about getting\n",
    "the house to the right temperature as quickly as possible. Classical\n",
    "control is widely used in robotic control and flight control.\n",
    "\n",
    "One interesting crossover between classical control and machine learning\n",
    "arises because classical optimal control can be seen as a form of\n",
    "model-based reinforcement learning. One where the reward is recovered\n",
    "when the set point is reached. In control engineering the prediction\n",
    "function is known as the *transfer function*. The process of fitting the\n",
    "transfer function in control is known as *system identification*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is some exciting work emerging at the interface between the areas\n",
    "of control and reinforcement learning. Results at this interface could\n",
    "be very important for improving the quality of robotic and drone\n",
    "control.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Optimization Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "As we implied above, reinforcement learning can also used to improve\n",
    "user experience. In that case the reward is gained when the user buys a\n",
    "product from us. This makes it closely allied to the area of\n",
    "optimization. Optimization of our user interfaces can be seen as a\n",
    "reinforcement learning task, but more commonly it is thought about\n",
    "separately in the domains of *Bayesian optimization* or *bandit\n",
    "learning*.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use optimization in machine learning to find the parameters of our\n",
    "models. We can do that because we have a mathematical representation of\n",
    "our objective function as a direct function of the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples in this form of optimization include, what is the best user\n",
    "interface for presenting adverts? What is the best design for a front\n",
    "wing for an F1 racing car? Which product should I return top of the list\n",
    "in response to this user's search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization arises when we can't directly relate the\n",
    "parameters in the system of interest to our objective through a\n",
    "mathematical function. For example, what is the mathematical function\n",
    "that relates a user's experience to the probability that they will buy a\n",
    "product?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Bayesian Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach to these problems is to use machine learning methods to\n",
    "develop a *surrogate model* for the optimization task. The surrogate\n",
    "model is a prediction function that attempts to recreate the process we\n",
    "are finding hard to model. We try to simultaneously fit the surrogate\n",
    "model and optimize the process.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Surrogate Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayesian optimization methods use a *surrogate model* (normally a\n",
    "specific form of regression model). They use this to predict how the\n",
    "real system will perform. The surrogate model makes a prediction (with\n",
    "an estimate of the uncertainty) of what the response will be to any\n",
    "given input. Parameters to test are chosen by considering this\n",
    "prediction. Similar to reinforcement learning, this can be viewed as a\n",
    "*model-based* approach because the surrogate model can be seen as a\n",
    "model of the real world. In bandit methods strategies are determined\n",
    "without turning to a model to motivate them. They are *model free*\n",
    "methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model-Based and Model Free: Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of their different philosophies, if a class of prediction\n",
    "functions is chosen, then a model-based approach might have better\n",
    "average case performance. At least in terms of *data efficiency*. A\n",
    "model free approach may well have better worst-case performance though,\n",
    "because it makes less assumptions about the nature of the data. To put\n",
    "it another way, making assumptions about the data is helpful if they are\n",
    "right: and if the model is sensible they'll be right on average.\n",
    "However, it is unhelpful if the model is wrong. Indeed, it could be\n",
    "actively damaging. Since we can't usually guarantee the model is\n",
    "absolutely right, the worst-case performance of a model-based approach\n",
    "would be poor.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have introduced a range of machine learning approaches by focusing on\n",
    "their use of mathematical functions to replace manually coded systems of\n",
    "rules. The important characteristic of machine learning is that the form\n",
    "of these functions, as dictated by their parameters, is determined by\n",
    "acquiring data from the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deployment \\[<a href=\"https://github.com/lawrennd/talks/edit/gh-pages/_ml/includes/deployment.md\" target=\"_blank\" >edit</a>\\]\n",
    "\n",
    "The methods we have introduced are roughly speaking introduced in order\n",
    "of difficulty of deployment. While supervised learning is more involved\n",
    "in terms of collection of data, it is the most straightforward method to\n",
    "deploy once that data is recovered. For this reason, a major focus with\n",

    "Masters level) is certainly required, but the quality of the final\n",
