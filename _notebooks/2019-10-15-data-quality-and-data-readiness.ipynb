    "> become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite\n",
    "> bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem\n",
    "> at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild\n",
    "> problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an\n",
    "> equally gigantic problem.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002), The Humble Programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "> The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more\n",
    "> interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but\n",
    "> data quality is often poor. What we need is cheap high-quality data.\n",
    "> That implies that we develop processes for improving and verifying\n",
    "> data quality that are efficient.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There would seem to be two ways for improving efficiency. Firstly, we\n",
    "> should not duplicate work. Secondly, where possible we should automate\n",

    "Just as with software, the crisis is most correctly addressed by\n",

    "\n",
    "Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level, three separate stages\n",
    "of data graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Grade C - accessibility\n",
    "    -   Transition: data becomes electronically available\n",
    "-   Grade B - validity\n",
    "    -   Transition: pose a question to the data.\n",
    "-   Grade A - usability\n",
    "\n",
    "The important definitions are at the transition. The move from Grade C\n",
    "data to Grade B data is delimited by the *electronic availability* of\n",
    "the data. The move from Grade B to Grade A data is delimited by posing a\n",
    "question or task to the data [@Lawrence:drl17].\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessibility: Grade C\n",
    "\n",
    "The first grade refers to the accessibility of data. Most data science\n",
    "practitioners will be used to working with data-providers who, perhaps\n",
    "having had little experience of data-science before, state that they\n",
    "\"have the data\". More often than not, they have not verified this. A\n",
    "convenient term for this is \"Hearsay Data\", someone has *heard* that\n",
    "they have the data so they *say* they have it. This is the lowest grade\n",
    "of data readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Progressing through Grade C involves ensuring that this data is\n",
    "accessible. Not just in terms of digital accessiblity, but also for\n",
    "regulatory, ethical and intellectual property reasons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Validity: Grade B\n",
    "\n",
    "Data transits from Grade C to Grade B once we can begin digital analysis\n",
    "on the computer. Once the challenges of access to the data have been\n",
    "resolved, we can make the data available either via API, or for direct\n",
    "loading into analysis software (such as Python, R, Matlab, Mathematica\n",
    "or SPSS). Once this has occured the data is at B4 level. Grade B\n",
    "involves the *validity* of the data. Does the data really represent what\n",
    "it purports to? There are challenges such as missing values, outliers,\n",
    "record duplication. Each of these needs to be investigated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Grade B and C are important as if the work done in these grades is\n",
    "documented well, it can be reused in other projects. Reuse of this\n",
    "labour is key to reducing the costs of data-driven automated decision\n",
    "making. There is a strong overlap between the work required in this\n",
    "grade and the statistical field of [*exploratory data\n",
    "analysis*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis)\n",
    "[@Tukey:exploratory77].\n",
    "\n",
    "The need for Grade B emerges due to the fundamental change in the\n",
    "availability of data. Classically, the scientific question came first,\n",
    "and the data came later. This is still the approach in a randomized\n",
    "control trial, e.g. in A/B testing or clinical trials for drugs. Today\n",
    "data is being laid down by happenstance, and the question we wish to ask\n",
    "about the data often comes after the data has been created. The Grade B\n",
    "of data readiness ensures thought can be put into data quality *before*\n",
    "the question is defined. It is this work that is reusable across\n",
    "multiple teams. It is these processes that the team which is *standing\n",
    "up* the data must deliver.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usability: Grade A\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the validity of the data is determined, the data set can be\n",
    "considered for use in a particular task. This stage of data readiness is\n",
    "more akin to what machine learning scientists are used to doing in\n",
    "Universities. Bringing an algorithm to bear on a well understood data\n",
    "set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Grade A we are concerned about the utility of the data given a\n",
    "particular task. Grade A may involve additional data collection\n",
    "(experimental design in statistics) to ensure that the task is\n",
    "fulfilled.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the stage where the data and the model are brought together, so\n",
    "expertise in learning algorithms and their application is key. Further\n",
    "ethical considerations, such as the fairness of the resulting\n",
    "predictions are required at this stage. At the end of this stage a\n",
    "prototype model is ready for deployment.\n",
