    "James Watt's steam engine contained an early machine learning device. In\n",

    "deployed in the steam engine. Studying stability in the governor is the\n",
    "main subject of James Clerk Maxwell's paper on the theoretical analysis\n",
    "of governors [@Maxwell:governors1867]. This paper is a founding paper of\n",
    "control theory. In an acknowledgment of its influence, Wiener used the\n",
    "name [*cybernetics*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics) to\n",

    "\n",
    "For example, *deep learning* makes use of *neural networks* to form the\n",

    "function that allows the algorithm designer to introduce invariances\n",
    "into the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An invariance is an important way of including prior understanding in a\n",

    "In the late sixties early software programmers made note of the\n",
    "increasing costs of software development and termed the challenges\n",

    "> become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite\n",
    "> bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem\n",
    "> at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild\n",

    "> equally gigantic problem.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Edsger Dijkstra (1930-2002), The Humble Programmer\n",
    "\n",
    "> The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more\n",
    "> interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but\n",
    "> data quality is often poor. What we need is cheap high-quality data.\n",
    "> That implies that we develop processes for improving and verifying\n",
    "> data quality that are efficient.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> There would seem to be two ways for improving efficiency. Firstly, we\n",
    "> should not duplicate work. Secondly, where possible we should automate\n",
    "> work.\n",
    "\n",
    "What I term \"The Data Crisis\" is the modern equivalent of this problem.\n",
    "The quantity of modern data, and the lack of attention paid to data as\n",
    "it is initially \"laid down\" and the costs of data cleaning are bringing\n",

    "core of the challenge of *technical debt* in machine learning\n",
    "[@Sculley:debt15].\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as with software, the crisis is most correctly addressed by\n",
    "'scaling' the manner in which we process our data. Duplication of work\n",
    "occurs because the value of data cleaning is not correctly recognised in\n",

    "driven by the cost of cleaning data, the paucity of tools for monitoring\n",
    "and maintaining our deployments, the provenance of our models (e.g. with\n",
    "respect to the data they’re trained on).\n",
    "\n",
    "Three principal changes need to occur in response. They are cultural and\n",
    "infrastructural.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data First Paradigm\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, to excel in data driven decision making we need to move\n",
    "from a *software first* paradigm to a *data first* paradigm. That means\n",
    "refocusing on data as the product. Software is the intermediary to\n",
    "producing the data, and its quality standards must be maintained, but\n",
    "not at the expense of the data we are producing. Data cleaning and\n",
    "maintenance need to be prized as highly as software debugging and\n",
    "maintenance. Instead of *software* as a service, we should refocus\n",
    "around *data* as a service. This first change is a cultural change in\n",
    "which our teams think about their outputs in terms of data. Instead of\n",
    "decomposing our systems around the software components, we need to\n",
    "decompose them around the data generating and consuming components.[^2]\n",
    "Software first is only an intermediate step on the way to becoming *data\n",
    "first*. It is a necessary, but not a sufficient condition for efficient\n",
    "machine learning systems design and deployment. We must move from\n",
    "*software orientated architecture* to a *data orientated architecture*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we need to improve our language around data quality. We cannot\n",
    "assess the costs of improving data quality unless we generate a language\n",
    "around what data quality means. Data Readiness Levels[^3] are an\n",

    "Starting with the analysis of a data set, the nature of data science is\n",
    "somewhat difference from classical software engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "One analogy I find helpful for understanding the depth of change we need\n",

    "on the ground. And for some reason you *know* that on that USB stick is\n",
    "a particular API call that will enable you to make a significant\n",

    "it could be that some of those library functions will hinder, perhaps\n",
    "because they are just inappropriate or perhaps because they have been\n",
    "placed there maliciously. The most secure thing to do would be to *not*\n",
    "introduce this code into your production system at all. But what if your\n",
    "manager told you to do so, how would you go about incorporating this\n",
    "code base?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is *very* carefully. You would have to engage in a process\n",
    "more akin to debugging than regular software engineering. As you\n",
    "understood the code base, for your work to be reproducible, you should\n",
    "be documenting it, not just what you discovered, but how you discovered\n",
    "it. In the end, you typically find a single API call that is the one\n",
    "that most benefits your system. But more thought has been placed into\n",
    "this line of code than any line of code you have written before.\n",
    "\n",
    "An enormous amount of debugging would be required. As the nature of the\n",
    "code base is understood, software tests to verify it also need to be\n",
    "constructed. At the end of all your work, the lines of software you\n",
    "write to actually interact with the software on the USB stick are likely\n",
    "to be minimal. But more thought would be put into those lines than\n",
    "perhaps any other lines of code in the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even then, when your API code is introduced into your production system,\n",
    "it needs to be deployed in an environment that monitors it. We cannot\n",
    "rely on an individual’s decision making to ensure the quality of all our\n",
    "systems. We need to create an environment that includes quality\n",
    "controls, checks and bounds, tests, all designed to ensure that\n",
    "assumptions made about this foreign code base are remaining valid.\n",
    "\n",
    "This situation is akin to what we are doing when we incorporate data in\n",
    "our production systems. When we are consuming data from others, we\n",
    "cannot assume that it has been produced in alignment with our goals for\n",
    "our own systems. Worst case, it may have been adversarially produced. A\n",
    "further challenge is that data is dynamic. So, in effect, the code on\n",
    "the USB stick is evolving over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "It might see that this process is easy to formalize now, we simply need\n",
    "to check what the formal software engineering process is for debugging,\n",
    "because that is the current software engineering activity that data\n",
    "science is closest to. But when we look for a formalization of\n",
    "debugging, we find that there is none. Indeed, modern software\n",

    "\n",
    "### Continuous Deployment\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "To extend the USB stick analogy further, how would we deploy that code\n",

    "production, it requires *continuous monitoring* to ensure the\n",
    "assumptions of design have not been invalidated. Software changes are\n",

    "existing functionality is not broken by change. Since data is\n",

    "continuous deployment does rely on testing, but it does not recognize\n",
    "the continuous evolution of the world around us.\n",
    "\n",

    "We need to shift our culture from standing up a software service, to\n",
