    "### Two Important Gaussian Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The Gaussian density has many important properties, but for the moment\n",
    "we'll review two of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sum of Gaussians\n",
    "\n",
    "If we assume that a variable, $\\dataScalar_i$, is sampled from a\n",
    "Gaussian density,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dataScalar_i \\sim \\gaussianSamp{\\meanScalar_i}{\\sigma_i^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can show that the sum of a set of variables, each drawn\n",
    "independently from such a density is also distributed as Gaussian. The\n",
    "mean of the resulting density is the sum of the means, and the variance\n",
    "is the sum of the variances,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{i=1}^{\\numData} \\dataScalar_i \\sim \\gaussianSamp{\\sum_{i=1}^\\numData \\meanScalar_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^\\numData \\sigma_i^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are very familiar with the Gaussian density and its properties,\n",
    "it is not immediately apparent how unusual this is. Most random\n",
    "variables, when you add them together, change the family of density they\n",
    "are drawn from. For example, the Gaussian is exceptional in this regard.\n",
    "Indeed, other random variables, if they are independently drawn and\n",
    "summed together tend to a Gaussian density. That is the [*central limit\n",
    "theorem*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem) which is\n",
    "a major justification for the use of a Gaussian density.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scaling a Gaussian\n",
    "\n",
    "Less unusual is the *scaling* property of a Gaussian density. If a\n",
    "variable, $\\dataScalar$, is sampled from a Gaussian density,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\dataScalar \\sim \\gaussianSamp{\\meanScalar}{\\sigma^2}$$ and we choose\n",
    "to scale that variable by a *deterministic* value, $\\mappingScalar$,\n",
    "then the *scaled variable* is distributed as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mappingScalar \\dataScalar \\sim \\gaussianSamp{\\mappingScalar\\meanScalar}{\\mappingScalar^2 \\sigma^2}.$$\n",
    "Unlike the summing properties, where adding two or more random variables\n",
    "independently sampled from a family of densitites typically brings the\n",
    "summed variable *outside* that family, scaling many densities leaves the\n",
    "distribution of that variable in the same *family* of densities. Indeed,\n",
    "many densities include a *scale* parameter (e.g. the [Gamma\n",
    "density](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_distribution)) which is\n",
    "purely for this purpose. In the Gaussian the standard deviation,\n",
    "$\\dataStd$, is the scale parameter. To see why this makes sense, let's\n",
    "consider, $$z \\sim \\gaussianSamp{0}{1},$$ then if we scale by $\\dataStd$\n",
    "so we have, $\\dataScalar=\\dataStd z$, we can write,\n",
    "$$\\dataScalar =\\dataStd z \\sim \\gaussianSamp{0}{\\dataStd^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regression Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "Regression involves predicting a real value, $\\dataScalar_i$, given an\n",
    "input vector, $\\inputVector_i$. For example, the Tecator data involves\n",
    "predicting the quality of meat given spectral measurements. Or in\n",
    "radiocarbon dating, the C14 calibration curve maps from radiocarbon age\n",
    "to age measured through a back-trace of tree rings. Regression has also\n",
    "been used to predict the quality of board game moves given expert rated\n",
    "training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Underdetermined System\n",
    "\n",
    "What about the situation where you have more parameters than data in\n",
    "your simultaneous equation? This is known as an *underdetermined*\n",
    "system. In fact this set up is in some sense *easier* to solve, because\n",
    "we don't need to think about introducing a slack variable (although it\n",
    "might make a lot of sense from a *modelling* perspective to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "The way Laplace proposed resolving an overdetermined system, was to\n",
    "introduce slack variables, $\\noiseScalar_i$, which needed to be\n",
    "estimated for each point. The slack variable represented the difference\n",
    "between our actual prediction and the true observation. This is known as\n",
    "the *residual*. By introducing the slack variable we now have an\n",
    "additional $n$ variables to estimate, one for each data point,\n",
    "$\\{\\noiseScalar_i\\}$. This actually turns the overdetermined system into\n",
    "an underdetermined system. Introduction of $n$ variables, plus the\n",
    "original $m$ and $c$ gives us $\\numData+2$ parameters to be estimated\n",
    "from $n$ observations, which actually makes the system\n",
    "*underdetermined*. However, we then made a probabilistic assumption\n",
    "about the slack variables, we assumed that the slack variables were\n",
    "distributed according to a probability density. And for the moment we\n",
    "have been assuming that density was the Gaussian,\n",
    "$$\\noiseScalar_i \\sim \\gaussianSamp{0}{\\dataStd^2},$$ with zero mean and\n",
    "variance $\\dataStd^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The follow up question is whether we can do the same thing with the\n",
    "parameters. If we have two parameters and only one unknown can we place\n",
    "a probability distribution over the parameters, as we did with the slack\n",
    "variables? The answer is yes.\n",
