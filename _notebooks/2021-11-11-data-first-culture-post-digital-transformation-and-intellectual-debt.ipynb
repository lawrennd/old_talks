    "The machine learning approach to artificial intelligence is to collect\n",
    "and annotate a large data set from humans. The problem is characterized\n",
    "by input data (e.g. a particular image) and a label (e.g. is there a car\n",
    "in the image yes/no). The machine learning algorithm fits a mathematical\n",
    "function (I call this the *prediction function*) to map from the input\n",
    "image to the label. The parameters of the prediction function are set by\n",
    "minimizing an error between the function’s predictions and the true\n",
    "data. This mathematical function that encapsulates this error is known\n",
    "as the *objective function*.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach to machine learning is known as *supervised learning*.\n",
    "Various approaches to supervised learning use different prediction\n",
    "functions, objective functions or different optimization algorithms to\n",
    "fit them.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, *deep learning* makes use of *neural networks* to form the\n",
    "predictions. A neural network is a particular type of mathematical\n",
    "function that allows the algorithm designer to introduce invariances\n",
    "into the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "An invariance is an important way of including prior understanding in a\n",
    "machine learning model. For example, in an image, a car is still a car\n",
    "regardless of whether it’s in the upper left or lower right corner of\n",
    "the image. This is known as translation invariance. A neural network\n",
    "encodes translation invariance in *convolutional layers*. Convolutional\n",
    "neural networks are widely used in image recognition tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative structure is known as a recurrent neural network (RNN).\n",
    "RNNs neural networks encode temporal structure. They use auto regressive\n",
    "connections in their hidden layers, they can be seen as time series\n",
    "models which have non-linear auto-regressive basis functions. They are\n",

    "Machine learning has been deployed in Speech Recognition (e.g. Alexa,\n",
    "deep neural networks, convolutional neural networks for speech\n",
    "recognition), in computer vision (e.g. Amazon Go, convolutional neural\n",
    "networks for person recognition and pose detection).\n",
    "\n",
    "The field of data science is related to AI, but philosophically\n",
    "different. It arises because we are increasingly creating large amounts\n",
    "of data through *happenstance* rather than active collection. In the\n",
    "modern era data is laid down by almost all our activities. The objective\n",
    "of data science is to extract insights from this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically, in the field of statistics, data analysis proceeds by\n",
