    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{data} + \\text{model} \\xrightarrow{\\text{compute}} \\text{prediction}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *data* is our observations. They can be actively or passively\n",
    "acquired (meta-data). The *model* contains our assumptions, based on\n",
    "previous experience. That experience can be other data, it can come from\n",
    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
    "biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a categorization or\n",
    "a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay\n",
    "of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in\n",
    "artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through\n",
    "computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To\n",
    "combine data with a model we typically make use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a prediction function** a function which is used to make the\n",
    "predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the\n",
    "universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness,\n",
    "spatial similarities, temporal similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**an objective function** a function which defines the cost of\n",

    "### Artificial Intelligence and Data Science\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning technologies have been the driver of two related, but\n",
    "distinct disciplines. The first is *data science*. Data science is an\n",
    "emerging field that arises from the fact that we now collect so much\n",
    "data by happenstance, rather than by *experimental design*. Classical\n",
    "statistics is the science of drawing conclusions from data, and to do so\n",
    "statistical experiments are carefully designed. In the modern era we\n",
    "collect so much data that there's a desire to draw inferences directly\n",
    "from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as machine learning, the field of data science draws from\n",
    "statistics, cloud computing, data storage (e.g. streaming data),\n",
    "visualization and data mining.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, artificial intelligence technologies typically focus on\n",
    "emulating some form of human behaviour, such as understanding an image,\n",
    "or some speech, or translating text from one form to another. The recent\n",
    "advances in artifcial intelligence have come from machine learning\n",
    "providing the automation. But in contrast to data science, in artifcial\n",
    "intelligence the data is normally collected with the specific task in\n",
    "mind. In this sense it has strong relations to classical statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Classically artificial intelligence worried more about *logic* and\n",
    "*planning* and focussed less on data driven decision making. Modern\n",
    "machine learning owes more to the field of *Cybernetics*\n",
    "[@Wiener:cybernetics48] than artificial intelligence. Related fields\n",
    "include *robotics*, *speech recognition*, *language understanding* and\n",
    "*computer vision*.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are strong overlaps between the fields, the wide availability of\n",
    "data by happenstance makes it easier to collect data for designing AI\n",
    "systems. These relations are coming through wide availability of sensing\n",
    "technologies that are interconnected by celluar networks, WiFi and the\n",
    "internet. This phenomenon is sometimes known as the *Internet of\n",
    "Things*, but this feels like a dangerous misnomer. We must never forget\n",

    "relationship with data means that we should consider it an intermediary.\n",

    "\n",
    "With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more\n",

    "various ways. If it's motives are not aligned with ours then it can\n",
    "misrepresent the information. This needn't be nefarious it can be simply\n",
    "as a result of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For\n",
    "example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that\n",
    "may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize\n",
    "information in a representative manner in the *shortest* possible length\n",

    "learning automates by emulating human (or other actions) found in data.\n",
    "Machine learning codifies in the form of a mathematical function that is\n",

    "ways in which they can interconnect, then we can also build systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning works through codifing a prediction of interest into a\n",
    "mathematical function. For example, we can try and predict the\n",
    "probability that a customer wants to by a jersey given knowledge of\n",
    "their age, and the latitude where they live. The technique known as\n",
    "logistic regression estimates the odds that someone will by a jumper as\n",
    "a linear weighted sum of the features of interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{odds} = \\frac{p(\\text{bought})}{p(\\text{not bought})} $$\n",
    "$$ \\log \\text{odds}  = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1 \\text{age} + \\beta_2 \\text{latitude}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $\\beta_0$, $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are the parameters of the model.\n",
    "If $\\beta_1$ and $\\beta_2$ are both positive, then the log-odds that\n",
    "someone will buy a jumper increase with increasing latitude and age, so\n",
    "the further north you are and the older you are the more likely you are\n",
    "to buy a jumper. The parameter $\\beta_0$ is an offset parameter, and\n",
    "gives the log-odds of buying a jumper at zero age and on the equator. It\n",
    "is likely to be negative\\[\\^logarithms\\] indicating that the purchase is\n",

    "like logistic regression are widely used to estimate probabilities from\n",
    "ad-click prediction to risk of disease.\n",

    "The pinball plot shows the flow of any input ball through the deep Gaussian process. In a pinball plot a series of vertical parallel lines would indicate a purely linear function. For the olypmic marathon data we can see the first layer begins to shift from input towards the right. Note it also does so with some uncertainty (indicated by the shaded backgrounds). The second layer has less uncertainty, but bunches the inputs more strongly to the right. This input layer of uncertainty, followed by a layer that pushes inputs to the right is what gives the heteroschedastic noise.\n",

    "### Accessibility: Grade C\n",
    "\n",
    "The first grade refers to the accessibility of data. Most data science\n",
    "practitioners will be used to working with data-providers who, perhaps\n",
    "having had little experience of data-science before, state that they\n",

    "### Validity: Grade B\n",

    "Data transits from Grade C to Grade B once we can begin digital analysis\n",

    "resolved, we can make the data available either via API, or for direct\n",

    "## Machine Learning System Design\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we are deploying artificial intelligence systems in practice is\n",
    "to build up systems of machine learning components. To build a machine\n",
    "learning system, we decompose the task into parts, each of which we can\n",
    "emulate with ML methods. These parts are typically independently\n",
    "constructed and verified. For example, in a driverless car we can\n",
    "decompose the tasks into components such as \"pedestrian detection\" and\n",
    "\"road line detection\". Each of these components can be constructed with,\n",
    "for example, an independent classifier. We can then superimpose a logic\n",
    "on top. For example, \"Follow the road line unless you detect a\n",
    "pedestrian in the road\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows for verification of car performance, as long as we can\n",
    "verify the individual components. However, it also implies that the AI\n",
    "systems we deploy are *fragile*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our intelligent systems are composed by \"pigeonholing\" each indvidual\n",
    "task, then substituting with a machine learning model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rapid Reimplementation\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the classical approach to automation, but in traditional\n",
    "automation we also ensure the *environment* in which the system operates\n",
    "becomes controlled. For example, trains run on railway lines, fast cars\n",
    "run on motorways, goods are manufactured in a controlled factory\n",
