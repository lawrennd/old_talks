    "What is Machine Learning?\n",
    "-------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "What is machine learning? At its most basic level machine learning is a\n",
    "combination of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{data} + \\text{model} \\xrightarrow{\\text{compute}} \\text{prediction}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where *data* is our observations. They can be actively or passively\n",
    "acquired (meta-data). The *model* contains our assumptions, based on\n",
    "previous experience. THat experience can be other data, it can come from\n",
    "transfer learning, or it can merely be our beliefs about the\n",
    "regularities of the universe. In humans our models include our inductive\n",
    "biases. The *prediction* is an action to be taken or a categorization or\n",
    "a quality score. The reason that machine learning has become a mainstay\n",
    "of artificial intelligence is the importance of predictions in\n",
    "artificial intelligence. The data and the model are combined through\n",
    "computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice we normally perform machine learning using two functions. To\n",
    "combine data with a model we typically make use of:\n",
    "\n",
    "**a prediction function** a function which is used to make the\n",
    "predictions. It includes our beliefs about the regularities of the\n",
    "universe, our assumptions about how the world works, e.g. smoothness,\n",
    "spatial similarities, temporal similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**an objective function** a function which defines the cost of\n",
    "misprediction. Typically it includes knowledge about the world’s\n",
    "generating processes (probabilistic objectives) or the costs we pay for\n",
    "mispredictions (empiricial risk minimization).\n",
    "\n",
    "The combination of data and model through the prediction function and\n",
    "the objectie function leads to a *learning algorithm*. The class of\n",
    "prediction functions and objective functions we can make use of is\n",
    "restricted by the algorithms they lead to. If the prediction function or\n",
    "the objective function are too complex, then it can be difficult to find\n",
    "an appropriate learning algorithm. Much of the acdemic field of machine\n",
    "learning is the quest for new learning algorithms that allow us to bring\n",

    "There is a fundamental limit placed on our intelligence based on our\n",
    "ability to communicate. Claude Shannon founded the field of information\n",
    "theory. The clever part of this theory is it allows us to separate our\n",
    "measurement of information from what the information pertains to[^1].\n",
    "\n",
    "Shannon measured information in bits. One bit of information is the\n",
    "amount of information I pass to you when I give you the result of a coin\n",
    "toss. Shannon was also interested in the amount of information in the\n",
    "English language. He estimated that on average a word in the English\n",
    "language contains 12 bits of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given typical speaking rates, that gives us an estimate of our ability\n",
    "to communicate of around 100 bits per second. Computers on the other\n",
    "hand can communicate much more rapidly. Current wired network speeds are\n",
    "around a billion bits per second, ten million times faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to compute though, our best estimates indicate our\n",
    "computers are slower. A typical modern computer can process make around\n",
    "100 billion floating point operations per second, each floating point\n",
    "operation involves a 64 bit number. So the computer is processing around\n",
    "6,400 billion bits per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s difficult to get similar estimates for humans, but by some\n",
    "estimates the amount of compute we would require to *simulate* a human\n",
    "brain is equivalent to that in the UK’s fastest computer, the MET office\n",
    "machine in Exeter, which in 2018 ranks as the 11th fastest computer in\n",
    "the world. That machine simulates the world’s weather each morning, and\n",
    "then simulates the world’s climate. It is a 16 petaflop machine,\n",
    "processing around 1,000 *trillion* bits per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when it comes to our ability to compute we are extraordinary, not\n",
    "compute in our conscious mind, but the underlying neuron firings that\n",
    "underpin both our consciousness, our sbuconsciousness as well as our\n",
    "motor control etc. By analogy I sometimes like to think of us as a\n",
    "Formula One engine. But in terms of our ability to deploy that\n",
    "computation in actual use, to share the results of what we have\n",
    "inferred, we are very limited. So when you imagine the F1 car that\n",
    "represents a psyche, think of an F1 car with bicycle wheels.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, our computers have less computational power, but they can\n",
    "communicate far more fluidly. They are more like a go-kart, less well\n",
    "powered, but with tires that allow them to deploy that power.\n",
    "\n",
    "For humans, that means much of our computation should be dedicated to\n",
    "considering *what* we should compute. To do that efficiently we need to\n",
    "model the world around us. The most complex thing in the world around us\n",
    "is other humans. So it is no surprise that we model them. We second\n",
    "guess what their intentions are, and our communication is only necessary\n",
    "when they are departing from how we model them. Naturally, for this to\n",
    "work well, we need to understand those we work closely with. So it is no\n",
    "surprise that social communication, social bonding, forms so much of a\n",
    "part of our use of our limited bandwidth.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a second effect here, our need to anthropomorphise objects\n",
    "around us. Our tendency to model our fellow humans extends to when we\n",
    "interact with other entities in our environment. To our pets as well as\n",
    "inanimate objects around us, such as computers or even our cars. This\n",
    "tendency to overinterpret could be a consequence of our limited ability\n",

    "Evolved Relationship with Information\n",
    "-------------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The high bandwidth of computers has resulted in a close relationship\n",
    "between the computer and data. Larege amounts of information can flow\n",
    "between the two. The degree to which the computer is mediating our\n",
    "relationship with data means that we should consider it an intermediary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Origininally our low bandwith relationship with data was affected by two\n",
    "characteristics. Firstly, our tendency to over-interpret driven by our\n",
    "need to extract as much knowledge from our low bandwidth information\n",
    "channel as possible. Secondly, by our improved understanding of the\n",
    "domain of *mathematical* statistics and how our cognitive biases can\n",
    "mislead us.\n",
    "\n",
    "With this new set up there is a potential for assimilating far more\n",
    "information via the computer, but the computer can present this to us in\n",
    "various ways. If it’s motives are not aligned with ours then it can\n",
    "misrepresent the information. This needn’t be nefarious it can be simply\n",
    "as a result of the computer pursuing a different objective from us. For\n",
    "example, if the computer is aiming to maximize our interaction time that\n",
    "may be a different objective from ours which may be to summarize\n",
    "information in a representative manner in the *shortest* possible lenght\n",
    "of time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for me it was a common experience to pick up my telephone\n",
    "with the intention of checking when my next appointme was, but to soon\n",
    "find myself distracted by another application on the phone, and end up\n",
    "reading something on the internet. By the time I’d finished reading, I\n",
    "would often have forgotten the reason I picked up my phone in the first\n",
    "place.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can benefit enormously from the very large amount of information we\n",
    "can now obtain through this evolved relationship between us and data.\n",
    "Biology has already benefited from large scale data sharing and the\n",
    "improved inferences that can be drawn through summarizing data by\n",
    "computer. That has underpinned the revolution in computational biology.\n",
    "But in our daily lives this phenomenon is affecting us in ways which we\n",
    "haven’t envisaged.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better mediation of this flow actually requires a better understanding\n",
    "of human-computer interaction. This in turn involves understanding our\n",
    "own intelligence better, what its cognitive biases are and how these\n",
    "might mislead us.\n",
