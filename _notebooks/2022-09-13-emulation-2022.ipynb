    "Such software is not only difficult to develop, but also to scale when\n",
    "computation demands increase. For example, Amazon’s original website\n",
    "software (called Obidos) was a [monolithic\n",

    "early noughties it was becoming difficult to sustain and maintain. The\n",

    "known as a ‘service-oriented architecture’.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Service Oriented Architecture, or “Software as a Service” the idea is\n",

    "API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer). So,\n",

    "One, the teams are working on a two-week cycle to digest information\n",
    "from the previous week’s race and incorporate updates to the car or\n",
    "their strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, businesses must also think about more medium-term horizons. For\n",
    "example, in Formula 1 you need to worry about next year’s car. So while\n",
    "you’re working on updating this year’s car, you also need to think about\n",
    "what will happen for next year and prioritize these conflicting needs\n",
    "appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Amazon supply chain, there are the equivalent demands. If we\n",
    "accept that an artificial intelligence is just an automated\n",
    "decision-making system. And if we measure in terms of money\n",
    "automatically spent, or goods automatically moved, then Amazon’s buying\n",
    "system is perhaps the world’s largest AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those decisions are being made on short time schedules; purchases are\n",
    "made by the system on weekly cycles. But just as in Formula 1, there is\n",
    "also a need to think about what needs to be done next month, next\n",
    "quarter and next year. Planning meetings are held not only on a weekly\n",
    "basis (known as weekly business reviews), but monthly, quarterly, and\n",
    "then yearly meetings for planning spends and investments.\n",

    "> change in the next 10 years?’ And I submit to you that that second\n",
    "> question is actually the more important of the two – because you can\n",
    "> build a business strategy around the things that are stable in time. …\n",
    "> \\[I\\]n our retail business, we know that customers want low prices,\n",
    "> and I know that’s going to be true 10 years from now. They want fast\n",
    "> delivery; they want vast selection. It’s impossible to imagine a\n",
    "> future 10 years from now where a customer comes up and says, ‘Jeff I\n",
    "> love Amazon; I just wish the prices were a little higher,’ \\[or\\] ‘I\n",
    "> love Amazon; I just wish you’d deliver a little more slowly.’\n",
    "> Impossible. And so the effort we put into those things, spinning those\n",
    "> things up, we know the energy we put into it today will still be\n",
    "> paying off dividends for our customers 10 years from now. When you\n",
    "> have something that you know is true, even over the long term, you can\n",
    "> afford to put a lot of energy into it.”\n",
    "\n",
    "This quote is incredibly important for long term thinking. Indeed, it’s\n",
    "a failure of many of our simulations that they focus on what is going to\n",
    "happen, not what will not happen. In Amazon, this meant that there was\n",
    "constant focus on these three areas, keeping costs low, making delivery\n",
    "fast and improving selection. For example, shortly before I left Amazon\n",
    "moved its entire US network from two-day delivery to one-day delivery.\n",
    "This involves changing the way the entire buying system operates. Or,\n",

    "<!--These challenges are not just there for Amazon and Formula 1. In Sheffield, we worked closely with a Chesterfield based company called Fusion Group. They make joints that fuse PTFE pipes together. These pipes are used for transporting both water and gas. Their founder, Eric Bridgstock, was an engineer who introduced PTFE piping to the UK when working for DuPont. Eric set up Fusion group to manufacture the fusion fittings. Because PTFE pipes carry water or gas at high pressure, when these fittings fail significant damage can occur. When these fittings were originally installed in the early 1980s, the job was done by a specialist, but nowadays the pipe weld is compelted by the same team that digs the hole. While costs have come down, the number of PTFE weld failures went up. Eric's company focussed on new systems for auto-->\n",

    "**Methods**. Relatively low-level techniques that are aimed that either\n",

    "Examples: Bayesian optimization, experimental design.\n",
    "\n",

    "explain complex system behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typical workflow that we envision for a user interested in emulation is:\n",
