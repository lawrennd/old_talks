\subsection{Summary}

* We've advocated Dimenstionality Reduction as a good way of modeling in high dimensions.
* Spectral techniques lead to convex algorithms.
* Probabilistic techniques map the ``correct way'' around.
  * This leads to problems with local minima.
* Have shown ability of probabilistic techniques to deal with high dimensional data.
