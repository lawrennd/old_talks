  \frametitle{Summary}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item We have explored two point based approaches to dimensionality reduction.
  \item Approaches seem to generalise well even when dimensions of data is
    greater than number of points.
  \item Both approaches are difficult to extend to higher dimensional latent
    spaces:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item number of samples/centres required increases exponentially with dimension.
    \end{itemize}
  \item Next we will explore a different probabilistic interpretation of PCA
    and extend that to non-linear models.
  \end{itemize}
