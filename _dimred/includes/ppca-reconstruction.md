\subsection{Reconstruction of the Data}

Given any posterior projection of a data point,
we can replot the original data as a function of the input space. 

We will now try to reconstruct the motion capture figure form some different places in the latent plot.

\writeassignment{Project the motion capture data onto its principal components, and then use the *mean posterior estimate* to reconstruct the data from the latent variables at the data points. Use two latent dimensions. What is the sum of squares error for the reconstruction?}{25}
