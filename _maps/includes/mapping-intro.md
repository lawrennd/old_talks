\subsection{Mapping Data}

\notes{Many of the questions we ask in data science are about how we live, who we are and how we might live better. So it is no surprise that an important source of information for data science comes from *mapping data*.}

\notes{Questions about how best to make deliveries, where to locate facilities, national disease susceptibility, how to get to work, where to go for a walk, disaster response[^haiti] and a myriad of other applications.

[^haiti]: For example the [OpenStreetMap response to the 2010 Haiti Earthquake](https://blog.openstreetmap.org/2010/01/14/haiti-openstreetmap-response/).}

\notes{The wider field of geospatial data analysis is also vital for monitoring our environment and human activity[^roof-measure] on our globe.

[^roof-measure]: For example this [UN Global Pulse](https://www.unglobalpulse.org/project/measuring-poverty-with-machine-roof-counting/) project which measures roof material as a proxy for poverty levels.}
