  This lecture will give the background to what this course is about, and how it fits in to other material you can find on deep neural network models. It explains deep neural networks are, how they fit into the wider context of the field and why they are successful.

\subsection{Ingredients}

\notes{The three key ingredients of machine learning are a model, data and compute. Note, that this necessarily implies that an *algorithm* exists to combine the model with the data and that algorithm is what consumes the compute.}

\notes{So how do these ingredients pan out in our recipe for deep learning? To better understand this, we're going to add more historical context and go back go 1997 when, here in Cambridge, there was a six-month programme at the Isaac Newton Institute run on Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Generalisation.}

\notes{At the same meeting Vladmir Vapnik was present, as was Bernhard Schölkopf. Corinna Cortes, Bernard Boser, Isabelle Guyon and Vladmir Vapnik were all instrumental in developing the Support Vector Machine.}

\notes{Also attending the summer school at the Newton Institute was Bernhard Schölkopf. He had shown that, on the same USPS digits data set, the support vector machine was able to achieve an error of 4.2% [@Scholkopf:comparing97]. It was also mathematically more elegant than the neural network approaches. Even on larger data sets, by incorporating the translation invariance [@Scholkopf:incorporating96], the support vector machine was able to achieve similar error rates to convolutional neural networks.}
