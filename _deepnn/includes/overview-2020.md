\subsection{Course Overview}

\notes{Deep Neural Networks is an eight we course that introduces you to the fundamental concepts behind deep learning with neural networks. Over the last decade, deep neural network models have been behind some of the most impressive feats in machine learning. From the [convolutional neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet) that made breakthrough progess on the [ImageNet challenge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet), object detection and the image net challenge, and most recently with the [CASP14 Protein Folding result from DeepMind](https://predictioncenter.org/casp14/doc/CASP14_press_release.html).}

\notes{Welcome to this course, which is designed to introduce you to the principles and ideas behind deep neural network models.}

\notes{Due to widespread international interest in neural networks there is now a great deal of material to help you train and deploy these models. It is not our aim to substitute this material but to augment it with deeper understanding of the reasons why deep learning is successful and the context in which that success has occurred.}

\notes{You are strongly encouraged to explore that material. For example, you can find [Yann LeCun's neural networks course from NYU here](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/). For example, [here is their introductory session](https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/) with Yann giving the first lecture available here.}

\notes{Our course is taught by Ferenc Huszár, Nic Lane and Neil Lawrence.}

\notes{Alongside such teaching material there are frameworks such as PyTorch, that help you in constructing these models and deploying the training on GPUs.}

\notes{Neural network models are not new, and this is not the first wave of interest in them, it is the third wave. There are reasons why they have become more successful in this wave than in their first two incarnations. Those reasons include the context in which they were reintroduced. In particular, the wide availability of *data* and *fast compute* have been critical in their success.}

\notes{Our aim is to give you the understanding of that context, and therefore deepen your understanding of neural networks, how and *when* they should be used. The neural network is not a panacea, it does not solve all the challenges of machine learning (at least not in its current incarnation). But it is a powerful framework for flexible modelling of data. Just like any powerful framework, it is important to understand its strengths as well as its limitations.}
