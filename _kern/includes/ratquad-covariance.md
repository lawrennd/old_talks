\notes{The rational quadratic covariance function is derived by a continuous mixture of exponentiated quadratic covariance funcitons, where the lengthscale is given by an inverse gamma distribution. The resulting covariance is infinitely smooth (in terms of differentiability) but has a family of length scales present. As $a$ gets larger, the exponentiated quadratic covariance funciton is recovered.}

\notes{The covariance takes the following form,
$$
\formula
$$
where $\ell$ is the *length scale* or *time scale* of the process and $\alpha$ represents the overall process variance and $a$ represents shape parameter of the inverse Gamma used to create the scale mixture.}
