\notes{The expontential covariance, in one dimension this is also known as the Ornstein Uhlenbeck covariance, and in multiple dimensions it's also the Mater 1/2 covaraince. It has an interpretation as a stochastic differential equation with a linear drift term (equivalent to a quadratic potential). The drift keeps the covariance stationary (unlike the Brownian motion covariance). It also has an interpretation as a Cauchy filter in Fourier space [@Stein:interpolation99] (from Bochner's theorem). 

The covariance takes the following form,
$$
\formula
$$
where $\ell$ is the *length scale* or *time scale* of the process and $\alpha$ represents the overall process variance.}
