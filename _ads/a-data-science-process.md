  In this lecture we introduce a data science process: access, assess and address. The process Given the landscape we've outlined, in this lecture we will look at the challenges of deploying data science solutions in practice. We categorize them into three groups.

\notes{We separated the challenges we face into three groups: (1) paradoxes of the odern data society, (2) quantifying the value of data and (3) privacy loss of control and marginalization. We've noted the origins of the paradoxes, speculating that it is based in a form of data (or modelling) inattention bias demonstrated through the Gorilla. We've drawn parallels between challenges of rewarding the addition of value and the credit assignment problem in reinforecement learning and we've looked at approaches to introduce the voice of marginalized societies and people into the conversation.}

\newslide{Data Context}

\slides{* Must not forget *context* of data.
* Three challenges:
  1. Paradoxes of Data Society
  2. Quantifying value of data
  3. Privacy, loss of control and marginalization
  * Place *people* at the heart.}

\newslide{Assignment}

\slide{* Base on Fynesse template.}

\notes{For your assignment in this unit, we'd like you to base your submission around the Fynesse framework[^other]. You can do this by forking the Fynesse template, or simply creating a python library which reflects that organisational structure.}


[^other]: If you find another approach to data science that also takes into account these aspects please feel to use that apparoach. We've designed this framework to help you think through the data science process and ensure that your aretefacts are more reusable.}

\subsection{Conclusions}

\slides{* Bandwidth constraints of humans
* Big Data Paradox
* Big Model Paradox
* Access, Assess, Address
}


\notes{The particular circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted the challenges of integrating scientific ideas to answer policy questions. In this talk, we've given a formal introduction to the problem, the difficulty of communicating between individuals (particularly from different domains) and reviewed the ideas and solutions we used in the Delve initiative.}

\notes{Recommendations from the DELVE Data report suggest that more effort needs to be placed into working in this manner in normal circumstances, so that when an emergency occurs we are better prepared to deal with the questions we face.}

\subsection{The Three Ds of Machine Learning Systems Design}


\slides{
* Three primary challenges of Machine Learning Systems Design.
1. Decomposition
2. Data 
3. Deployment
}

\notes{We can characterize the challenges for integrating machine learning within our systems as the three Ds. Decomposition, Data and Deployment.}

\notes{The first two components *decomposition* and *data* are interlinked, but we will first outline the decomposition challenge. Below we will mainly focus on *supervised learning* because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.}

\section{Delve}

\notes{There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but we’re still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed on some of the foundational issues around data use – access, skills, culture – before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI. [link here to data readiness]}

\notes{Delivering a rapid response requires the ability to quickly convene teams from across disciplines (and often institutions) around a key question. To facilitate this, we also used ideas from \addblog{open data science}{2014/07/01/open-data-science} to facilitate communication and understanding.}
