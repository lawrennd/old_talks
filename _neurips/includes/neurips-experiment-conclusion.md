\subsection{Conclusion}

\notes{Under the simple model we have outlined, we can be confident that there is inconsistency between two independent committees, but the level of inconsistency is much less than we would find for a random committee. If we accept that the bias introduced by the Area Chairs knowing when they were dealing with duplicates was minimal, then if we were to revisit the NIPS 2014 conference with an independent committee then we would expect between **38% and 64% of the presented papers to be the same**. If the conference was run at random, then we would only expect 25% of the papers to be the same.

It's apparent from comments and speculation about what these results mean, that some people might be surprised by the size of this figure. However, it only requires a little thought to see that this figure is likely to be large for any highly selective conference if there is even a small amount of inconsistency in the decision-making process. This is because once the conference has chosen to be 'highly selective' then because, by definition, only a small percentage of papers are to be accepted. Now if we think of a type I error as accepting a paper which should be rejected, such errors are easier to make because, again by definition, many more papers should be rejected. Type II errors (rejecting a paper that should be accepted) are less likely because (by setting the accept rate low) there are fewer papers that should be accepted in the first place. When there is a difference of opinion between reviewers, it does seem that many of the aruguments can be distilled down to (a subjective opinion) about whether controlling for type I or type II errors is more important. Further, normally when discussing type I and type II errors we believe that the underlying system of study is genuinely binary: e.g., diseased or not diseased. However, for conferences the accept/reject boundary is not a clear separation point, there is a continuum (or spectrum) of paper quality (as there also is for some diseases). And the decision boundary often falls in a region of very high density.}

\slides{* For parallel-universe NIPS we expect between 38% and 64% of the presented papers to be the same. 
* For random-parallel-universe NIPS we only expect 25% of the papers to be the same.}
