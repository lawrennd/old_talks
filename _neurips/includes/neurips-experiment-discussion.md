\subsection{Discussion}

\notes{As with any decision making process there are two types of errors we can make, a type I error is accepting a paper that should be rejected. A type II error is rejecting a paper that shoudl be accepted. Many discussions about reviewing could be summarised as subjective opinions about whether controlling for type I or type II is more important. When accept rates are low type I errors are *much more common*.}

\notes{Many of these discussions seem to be based on a premise that there's an underlying boundary of acceptable/non-acceptable papers. But for conferences it is clear there is no separation point, there is a spectrum of paper quality.}

\slides{* Error types:
  * type I error as accepting a paper which should be rejected.
  * type II error rejecting a paper should be accepted.
* Controlling for error:
  * many reviewer discussions can be summarised as *subjective* opinions about whether controlling for type I or type II is more important.
  * with low accept rates, type I errors are *much* more common.
* Normally in such discussions we believe there is a clear underlying boundary.
* For conferences there is no clear separation points, there is a spectrum of paper quality.
* Should be explored alongside *paper scores*.}
