\paragraph{AC recruitment (3 waves)}

Chairing a conference starts with recruitment of the program committee, which is usually done in a few stages. The primary task is to recruit the area chairs. We sent out our program committee invites in three waves.

* 17/02/2014
* 08/03/2014
* 09/04/2014

By recruiting area chairs first, you can involve them in recruiting reviewers. We requested names of reviewers from ACs in two waves.

* 25/03/2014
* 11/04/2014

In 2014, this wasn't enough to obtain the requisite number of reviewers, so we used additional approaches. These included lists of previous NeurIPS authors. For each individual we were looking for at least two previously-published papers from NeurIPS and other leading  leading ML venues like ICML, AISTATS, COLT, UAI etc.. We made extensive use of [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/) for verifying each potential reviewer's publication track record.

* 14/04/2014
* 28/04/2014
