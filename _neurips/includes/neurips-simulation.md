\subsection{Conference Simulation}

\notes{Given the realization that roughly 50% of the score seems to be 'subjective' and 50% of the score seems to be 'objective', then we can simulate the conference and see what it does for the accept precision for different probability of accept.}

\slides{* Calibration model suggests score is roughly 50% subjective, 50% objective.
* Duplicate experiment backs this up with roughly 50% correlation.}

\newslide{Experiment}

\notes{To explore the effect of the subjective scoring on the accept precision we construct a simple simulation that scores hypothetical papers with random values drawn from a Gaussian density. Each paper has an underlying objective score (shared across the hypothetical reviewers), and then alongside it there are Gaussian variables drawn independently at random to represent the subjectivity of the hypothetical reviewers.}

\notes{Each paper is rated by two independent committees, and the papers are reordered to accept the top $x$% where $x$ is our chosen accept rate. We can then use sample based estimates for the resulting accept precision.}

\notes{In these experiments the scores are taken to be 50% subjective and 50% objective, in line with the results we see from the NeurIPS 2014 calibration model. We vary the number of reviewers in the simulation to see the effect of increasing reviewers on the accept precision.}

\slides{* Simulate conference scores which are 50% subjective/objective.
* Study statistics of conference.}
