\subsection{Speculation}

\notes{With the help of [Nicolo Fusi](http://nicolofusi.com/), [Charles Twardy](http://blog.scicast.org/tag/charles-twardy/) and the entire Scicast team we launched [a Scicast question](https://scicast.org/#!/questions/1083/trades/create/power) a week before the results were revealed. The comment thread for that question already had [an amount of interesting comment](https://scicast.org/#!/questions/1083/comments/power) before the conference. Just for informational purposes before we began reviewing Corinna forecast this figure would be 25% and I forecast it would be 20%. The box plot summary of predictions from Scicast is below.}
