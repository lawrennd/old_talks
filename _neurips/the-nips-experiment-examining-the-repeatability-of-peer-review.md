title: The NIPS Experiment
abstract: The peer review process can be difficult to navigate for newcomers. In this
  informal talk we will review the results of the NIPS experiment, an experiment on
  the repeatability of peer review conducted for the 2014 conference. We will try
  to keep the presentation information to ensure questions can be asked. With luck
  it will give more insight into the processes that a program committee goes through
  when selecting papers.

\notes{The NIPS experiment was an experiment to determine the consistency of the review process. After receiving papers we selected 10% that would be independently rereviewed. The idea was to determine how consistent the decisions between the two sets of independent papers would be. In 2014 NIPS received 1678 submissions and we selected 170 for the experiment. These papers are referred to below as 'duplicated papers'.}

\notes{To run the experiment we created two separate committees within the NIPS program committee. The idea was that the two separate committees would review each duplicated paper independently and results compared.}
