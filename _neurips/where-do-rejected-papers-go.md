  Of the 1,678 papers submitted to the 2014 conference, only 414 were presented at the meeting. In this notebook we trace the fate of the remaining papers. In revisiting the 2014 NeurIPS experiment, we explored the fate of over 1000 rejected papers. We found that 680 were available in some form on line. In this notebook we explore where those papers were published.
