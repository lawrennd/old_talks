\notes{The book, "Why Red Doesn't Sound Like a Bell" by J. Kevin O'Regan [@ORegan:whyred19] suggests a sensorimotor approach to understanding our consciousness. One that depends on how our senses interact with the world around us. The implication is that our consciousness is as much a function of our environment as of our mind. This is particularly interesting for social interaction, where our external environment is populated by other intelligent entities. If we accept this interpretation it would imply that we should pay a lot of attention to modes of human to human interaction when developing environments in which we can feel comfortable and able to perform.}
