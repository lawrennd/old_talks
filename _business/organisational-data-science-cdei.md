title: "Organisational Data Science"
abstract:  >
  In this talk we review the challenges in making an organisation data-driven in its decision making. Building on experience working within Amazon and providing advice through the Royal Society convened DELVE group we review challenges and solutions for improving the data capabilities of an institution. This talk is targeted at data-aware leaders working in an institution.

\comment{lots of relevant ideas for this away day in your 10DS remarks (I particularly liked the focus on 'brownfield innovation'), while perhaps drawing out some of the themes in your presentations on data governance? As such, perhaps you could talk about what it takes to achieve responsible innovation in the context of different organisational cultures?}

\notes{With the Amazon and F1 examples in mind, I'd like to suggest that no-one is (yet) doing data-science well at *scale*. And that is largely to do with how recently we've gained these capabilities. But with that in mind we'll I'd like to look at some solutions for integrating the necessary change in culture.}

\section{Four Current Examples of Interventions from My Work}

\newslide{Accelerate Program: Empower the User}

\notes{Other examples of this form of work include our collaboration with [Data Science Africa](http://www.datascienceafrica.org/), which focusses on empowering individuals with solutions for solving challenges that emerge in the African context.}

\subsection{Data Trusts: Empower People through their Data}

\notes{The third intervention goes direct to the source of the machine's power. What we are seeing is an emergent *[digital oligarchy](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2015/mar/05/digital-oligarchy-algorithms-personal-data)* based on the power that comes with aggregation of data. [Data Trusts](https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/2016/jun/03/data-trusts-privacy-fears-feudalism-democracy) are form of data intermediary designed to reutrn the power associated with this data accumulation to the originators of the data, that is us.}

\section{Conclusions}

\newslide{Overview}

\slides{* Challenge
  * institutional character and information infrastructure are interlinked.
  * transplantation of a data-science culture from outside can lead to rejection.
* Solution
  * Information infrastructure and institutional character need to co-evolve.}

\notes{In this talk I've put forward the idea that an institution's character and its information infrastructure are interlinked. This implies that by reforming the information infrastructure, through wider provision of data-driven decision making capabilities, we are also interacting with the institutional character.}

\notes{Many approaches to integrating data science ignore this and suffer from a phenomenon we can think of as organisational rejection. Despite the intent of the executive, the new capability is isolated from the wider institution and rendered ineffective.}

\notes{The solution is to co-evolve the information infrastructure and the organisational culture. I've introduced five specific actions for doing this.}

\newslide{Actions}

1. Institution wide data maturity assessments.
2. Executive sponsorship of the data science core.
3. Pathfinder projects that are intersectional.
4. Data science champions who come from the domains of deployment.
5. Bridging courses that integrate institutional questions of important within data science education.

\newslide{Key Theme}

\slides{* These are actions that deliver a short term benefit while encouraging longer term cultural change.}

\notes{The key design criterion for these actions is that each of these ideas brings short term benefits as well as effecting long term cultural change. Any idea that delivers on these two fronts is also likely to be suitable for integration in an institutional data-science programme.}
