\subsection{Institutional Character}

\notes{Before we start, I'd like to highlight one idea that will be key for contextualisation of everything else. There is a strong interaction between the structure of an organisation and the structure of its software.}

\notes{This is known as Conway's law:} 

\notes{> Organizations, who design systems, are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations.

\newslide{Amazon and Agility}

\slides{* Company prides itself on agility.
* Operates through a system of *devolved autonomy*
  * Teams have defined inputs and outputs.
* Corporate culture bonds them togethether.
  * Customer obsession
  * Ownership}

\notes{Amazon prides itself on agility, I spent three years there and I can confirm things move very quickly. I used to joke that just as a dog year is seven normal years, an Amazon year is four normal years in any other company.}

\notes{Not all institutions move quickly. My current role is at the University of Cambridge. There are similarities between the way a University operates and the way Amazon operates. In particular Universities exploit *devolved autonomy* to empower their research leads.}

\notes{Naturally there are differences too, for example, Universities do less work on developing *culture*. Corporate culture is a critical element in ensuring that despite the devolved autonomy of Amazon, there is a common vision.}

\newslide{Cambridge}

\slides{* Over 800 years old.
  * Less commonly thought of as agile.
  * Reliable institutional character.
  * Amazon in comparison is more mecurial.}
  

\notes{Cambridge University is over 800 years old. Agility is not a word that is commonly used to describe its institutional framework. I don't want to make a claim for whether an agile institution is better or worse, it's circumstantial. Institutions have characters, like people. The institutional character of the University is the one of a steady and reliable friend. The institutional character of Amazon is more mecurial.}

\newslide{Organisational Data Science}

\slides{* Claim:
  * For data driven decision making to work there must be an interplay between institutional character and the information infrastructure.}
\notes{Why do I emphasise this? Because when it comes to organisational data science, when it comes to a data driven culture around our decision making, that culture inter-plays with the institutional character. If decision making is truly data-driven, then we should expect co-evolution between the information infrastructure and the institutional structures.}

\notes{A common mistake I've seen is to transplant a data culture from one (ostensibly) successful institution to another. Such transplants commonly lead to organisational rejection. The institutional character of the new host will have cultural antibodies that operate against the transplant even if, at some (typically executive) level the institution is aware of the vital need for integrating the data driven culture.}

\newslide{Cultural Transplant}

\slides{* Claim:
  * Transplanting another organisation's decision making infrastructure directly leads cultural rejection from the new host.}

\notes{A major part of my job at Amazon was dealing with these tensions. As a scientist, initially working across the company, working with my team introduced dependencies and practices that impinged on the devolved autonomy. I face a similar challenge at Cambridge. Our aim is to integrate data driven methodologies with the classical sciences, humanities and across the academic spectrum. The devolved autonomy inherent in University research provides a similar set of challenges to those I faced at Amazon.}

\notes{My role before Amazon was at the University of Sheffield. Those were quieter times in terms of societal interest in machine learning and data science, but the Royal Society was already convening a working group on Machine Learning. This was my first interaction with policy advice, I've continued that interaction today by working with the AI Council, convening [the DELVE group](https://rs-delve.github.io) to give pandemic advice, serving on the [Advisory Council for the Centre for Science and Policy](https://www.csap.cam.ac.uk/about-csap/people/governance/advisory-council/), and the [Advisory Board for the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/advisory-board-of-the-centre-for-data-ethics-and-innovation/advisory-board-of-the-centre-for-data-ethics-and-innovation). I'm not an expert on the civil service and government, but I can see that many of the themes I've outlined above also apply within government. The ideas I'll talk about today build on the experiences I've had at Sheffield, Amazon, and Cambridge alongside the policy work I've been involved in to mak suggestions of what the barriers are for enabling a culture of data driven policy making.}
