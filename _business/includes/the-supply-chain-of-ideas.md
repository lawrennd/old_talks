\notes{Another friend of mine who still works for Jeff is called
Narayan. Narayan has spent his life working in supply chain. He liked
to tell me about a man by a river in Kerala, South India who sold
coconuts. The man sat beside a river and sold coconuts to people on
boats. The man would sit under a coconut tree. When someone stopped to
buy a coconut the man would climb the tree and cut down a coconut and
sell it to the customer. When that tree ran out of coconuts the man
would move to another tree. Narayan used to say that this man had the
shortest supply chain in the world. Then Narayan would laugh his
booming laugh.}

\notes{When he'd stopped laughing, Narayan would tell me that the magic of
supply chain is it takes the waiting away. It makes all the customers
feel that everything grows on trees, and its all sitting there ripe
and ready to pluck. And all that's happening is that the store-owner
is popping up the tree and bringing us a fresh one down.}
