\subsection{Data Science Champions}

\notes{This gives us two interventions that can be characterised as developing executive awareness. But the data maturity assessment has the additional advantage of raising awareness amoung technical staff. The questions in a data maturity assessment have the effect of reminding technical staff what should be possible. Unless those that are doing the analysis are demanding the right tools, then the culture of the organisation won't change to do that. Cultural change needs to be bottom up as well as top down.}

\notes{The third intervention focuses more specifically on the bottom-up.}

\slides{* Data science knowledge needs to be devolved to domain experts.
  * This gives scalability and ensures cultural compatibility.
* Programme of *data science champions*
  * Centrally educated, but redeployed into their domains.}

\notes{Any capable institution will have a large degree of domain specific expertise that they deploy in their daily processes. For example, in Amazon we had supply chain experts who had been at the company for over 20 years. They often came from an Operations Research background, or perhaps an economics background. When introducing new machine learning technologies to these experts, one of two reactions was typically encountered. Either the technology was viewed with great suspicion, or it was seen as a panacea. In the former case, there was no trust in my team, in the latter case there was a naive and unwarranted total faith in my team. A productive relationship is only formed where there is the correct amount of respect between the two domains of expertise. Unfortunately, the typical approach is to parachute in inexperienced (often younger) machine learning experts into teams of technically experience (often older) domain experts.}

\notes{One solution to this quandry is to make the domain experts data science champions. This involves championing their expertise and bringing them in to the centre of data science expertise to develop their understanding of how an information infrastructure could/should be developed in their domain. This leads to a two-way exchange of ideas. The core data science team understands the domains better, and the domain experts understand data science better.}

\notes{The key point about these champions is that they are centrally educated, bringing together a cross-departmental community, but when appropriate they are redeployed into their own domains to represent these approaches "at the coal face".}

\notes{The data science champion is then redeployed back to their home department as data science champions within their domain. The key idea is that it's the domain experts that need to champion the data science techniques. This is important for both scalability of data science capability, and for ensuring that the data-driven decision making becomes embedded in the wider institutional culture.}

\notes{I sometimes refer to these forms of operations as acting as multipliers of capability instead of additional capability. Additional capability would involve adding a data scientist to every team where she is needed. Multiplying capability involves infusing existing teams with data science capabilities.}
