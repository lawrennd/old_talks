\subsection{Solow Paradox}

> You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.
>
> Robert Solow in @Solow-computers87

\notes{Artificial intelligence promises automated decision making that will alleviate and revolutionise the nature of work. In practice, we know from previous technological solutions, new technologies often take time to percolate through to productivity. Robert Solow’s paradox saw “the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics”. Solow was reviewing @Cohen-manufacturing87 and he quotes them

> We do not need to show that the new technologies produce a break with past patterns of productivity growth. ... [That] would depend not just on the possibilities the technologies represent, but rather on how effectively they are used.
>
> Stephen S. Cohen and John Zysman in @Cohen-manufacturing87 quoted by Solow.
}

\notes{This point about effectiveness of use can be equally deployed in the current "revolution" for artificial intelligence. Today, when computers are integrated into our automation of process they are rarely mentioned. We will know that AI is truly successful when we stop talking about it.}
