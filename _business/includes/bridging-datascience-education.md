\subsection{Bridging Data Science Education}

\slides{* Important to integrate education into the domain.
* Bolt-on education is widespread (and can be leveraged).
* But domain specific education critical for effective deployment.
}
\notes{A final piece from the puzzle I would like to mention is education. While there are courses springing up teaching data science in Universities, on-line etc, my own feeling is that these approaches are far less effective than a tailored and integrated approach.}

\notes{As part of the [Accelerate Programme for Scientific Discovery](https://acceleratescience.github.io) in Cambridge, we have designed a set of bridging courses. These are bootcamp style courses that work closely with researchers, typically PhD students, post-docs but also Masters students and university lecturers. They teach the hands-on skills that are needed to deliver solutions.}

\notes{Rather than starting with trying to communicate the complex machine learning models that have underpinned the AI revolution, we teach the fundamental tools of data science, for example how to build data sets, including tutorials on extracting data from the web. This approach is taken from noting that most people spend most of their time developing the data set, not modeling. It is this work we need to invest in.}

\notes{Our courses are tailored and built around examples that attendees bring to their teaching. They are delivered in partnership with [Cambridge Spark](https://www.cambridgespark.com), a local start up focussed on data science education.}
