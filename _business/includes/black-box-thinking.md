\notes{We must also be careful to maintain openness in this new genaration of digital solutions across health and society. Matthew Syed's book, *Black Box Thinking* [@Syed:blackbox15], emphasizes the importance of surfacing errors as a route to learning and improved process. Taking aviation as an example, and contrasting it with the culture in medicine, Matthew relates the story of [Martin Bromiley](https://chfg.org/trustees/martin-bromiley/), an airline pilot whose wife died during a routine hospital procedure and his efforts to improve the culture of safety in medicine. The motivation for the book is the difference in culture between aviation and medicine in how errors are acknowledged and dealt with. We must ensure that these high standards of oversight apply to the era of data-driven automated decision making. }
