\subsection{Executive Sponsorship}

\slides{* Direct sponsorship from the most senior executive.
  * This has a cultural effect as well as a direct effect.
* Bring about through *involvement*
  * develops understanding of capabilities of data science in exec team.}

\notes{Another lever that can be deployed is that of *executive sponsorship*. My feeling is that organisational change is most likely if the executive is seen to be behind it. This feeds the corporate culture. While it may be a *necessary* condition, or at least it is helpful, it is not a *sufficient* condition. It does not solve the challenge of the institutional antibodies that will obstruct long term change. Here by executive sponsorship I mean that of the CEO of the organisation. That might be equivalent to the Prime Minister or the Cabinet Secretary.}

\notes{A key part of this executive sponsorship is to develop understanding in the executive of how data driven decision making can help, while also helping senior leadership understand what the pitfalls of this decision making are.}

\subsection{Pathfinder Projects}

\slides{* In executive context: an important project that is interdepartmental.
* Should involve the CEO, CFO, CIO and data science team (or equivalents).}

\notes{I do exec education courses for the Judge Business School. One of my main recommendations there is that a project is developed that directly involves the CEO, the CFO and the CIO (or CDO, CTO ... whichever the appropriate role is) and operates on some aspect of critical importance for the business.}

\notes{The inclusion of the CFO is critical for two purposes. Firstly, financial data is one of the few sources of data that tends to be of high quality and availability in any organisation. This is because it is one of the few forms of data that is regularly audited. This means that such a project will have a good chance of success. Secondly, if the CFO is bought in to these technologies, and capable of understanding their strengths and weaknesses, then that will facilitate the funding of future projects.}

\notes{In the DELVE data report [@Delve-data20], we translated this recommendation into that of "pathfinder projects". Projects that cut across departments, and involve treasury. Although I appreciate the nuances of the relationship between Treasury and No 10 do not map precisely onto that of CEO and CFO in a normal business. However, the importance of cross cutting exemplar projects that have the close attention of the executive remains.}
