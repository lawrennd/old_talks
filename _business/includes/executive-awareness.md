\subsection{Executive Awareness}

\notes{The first challenge is the Executive Awareness.}

\notes{In most organisations decision making capability sits with a
fairly restricted cadre. For this group to be empowered in decision
making, they need to be aware of the problems. Institutional awareness
honed through experience is a typical characteristic of this
cadre. However, that experience was honed without the modern
capabilities we have around data. This means that the intuitions that
the executive have about the barriers to data driven decision making
are often incorrect. This challenge was even true in Amazon. Despite
the Software-as-a-Service approach, data quality within Amazon tended
to suffer because it wasn't monitored. The scale of this problem
wasn't apparent to senior managers until, with my colleague Daniel
Marcu, we agitated for questions on data maturity to be assimilated
within the organisations annual tech survey. I'll refer to these
questions as a Data Maturity Assessment.}
