title: "Post-Digital Transformation, Decision Making and Intellectual Debt"
abstract: |
  Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving from a
  manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be
  rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital
  transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers,
  logistic networks) into the world of bits.

  I’ll discuss how the artificial systems we have developed operate
  in a fundamentally different way to our own intelligence. I’ll
  describe how this difference in operational capability leads us to
  misunderstand the influence the nature of decisions made by machine
  intelligence.

  Developing this understanding is important in integrating human
  decisions with those from the machine. These ideas are designed to
  help with the challenge of 'post digital transformation': doing
  business in a digital world.

\notes{As a more general example, let's consider fairness in decision making. Computers make decisions on the basis of our data, how can we have confidence in those decisions?}

\notes{But when considering fairness, it seems that there's two forms that we might consider.}
