title: Data First Culture
subtitle: Post-Digital Transformation and Intellectual Debt
abstract: >
  Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving from a
  manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be
  rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital
  transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers,
  logistic networks) into the world of bits. But the real challenges
  may start once this is complete. In this talk we introduce the
  notion of 'post digital transformation': the challenges of doing
  business in a digital world.

\notes{And this is very likely true, but in practice we know that even if the disruption is being felt initially by the professional classes, those groups tend to be protected by their ability to adapt, which is correlated with higher education.}

\notes{Whether this remains true this time is another question. I'm particularly struck by the "convergent evolution" of ChatGPT. The model is trained by reinforcement learning with feedback provided by people. ChatGPT's answers are highly plausible, make use of sophisticated language in an intelligent sounding way and are often incorrect. I'm struck by the similarity to fresh Oxbridge graduates. I wonder if this is also an example of convergent evolution.}
