title: "Future of AI and Machine Learning"
venue: "Executive MBA Course, Judge Business School, University of Cambridge"
abstract: >
  Machine learning technologies have driven a revolution in artificial intelligence. Our machines are now able to identify objects in images, transcribe spoke language, translate between languages and even generate text of their own.
  
  In this talk we consider what this means for the future of AI and our own intelligence with a particular focus on what the opportunities and pitfalls for businesses are.
