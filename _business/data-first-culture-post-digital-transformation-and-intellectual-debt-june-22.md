title: Data First Culture
subtitle: Post-Digital Transformation and Intellectual Debt
abstract: >
  Digital transformation has offered the promise of moving from a
  manual decision-making world to a world where decisions can be
  rational, data-driven and automated. The first step to digital
  transformation is mapping the world of atoms (material, customers,
  logistic networks) into the world of bits. But the real challenges
  may start once this is complete. In this talk we introduce the
  notion of 'post digital transformation': the challenges of doing
  business in a digital world.
