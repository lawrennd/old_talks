\subsection{Brief History of the Cloud}

\notes{In the early days of the internet, companies could make use of open source software, such as the Apache web server and the MySQL database for providing on line stores, or other capabilities. But as part of that, they normally had to provide their own server farms. For example, the earliest server for running PageRank from 1996 was hosted on custom made hardware built in a case of Mega Blocks (see Figure \ref{the-first-google-computer-at-stanford}).}

\notes{By September 2000, Google operated 5000 PCs for searching and web crawling, using the LINUX operating system.[^stanford-infolab]

\notes{Cloud computing gives you access to computing at a simular scale, but on an as-needed basis. AWS launched S3 cloud storage in March 2006 and the Elastic Compute Cloud followed in August 2006. These services were inspired the challenges they had scaling their own web service for running the world's largest e-commerce site. Recent market share estimates indicate that AWS still retains around a third of the cloud infrastructure market.[^aws-market-share]

[^aws-market-share]: There are various reports that try to track market share, here's one from Gartner from June 2021: <https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-06-28-gartner-says-worldwide-iaas-public-cloud-services-market-grew-40-7-percent-in-2020>. It looks at revenue that suggests Amazon retains 40% with Microsoft second largest on 20%.}
