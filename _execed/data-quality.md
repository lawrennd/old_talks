\subsection{Machine Learning}
$$
\text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}
$$

\subsection{Code and Data Separation}

* Classical computer science separates code and data.
* Machine learning short-circuits this separation.


\subsection{Example: Supply Chain}

\section{Introduction}



\subsection{Conclusions}

* Data is modern software
* We need to revisit software engineering and computer science in this context.
