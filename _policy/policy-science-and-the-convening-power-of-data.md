title: Policy, Science and the Convening Power of Data
abstract: |
  With the world watching case numbers increase and publics and
  policymakers scrutinising projections from epidemiological models,
  the covid-19 pandemic brought with it increased attention on the use
  of data to inform policy. Alongside this scrutiny came a new wave of
  interest in the ability of data and artificial intelligence (AI) to
  help tackle major scientific and social challenges: could our
  increasing ability to collect, combine and interrogate large
  datasets lead to new insights that unlock more effective policy
  responses? Experiences from the DELVE Initiative, convened to bring
  data science to bear on covid-19 policy, suggests achieving this aim
  requires wider adoption of open data science methods to deploy data
  science and AI expertise and resources to tackle real-world
  problems.

\subsection{What is Machine Learning?}

$$ \text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}$$


\notes{Any policy question can be framed in a number of different
ways - what are the health outcomes; what is the impact on NHS
capacity; how are different groups affected; what is the economic
impact – and each has different types of evidence associated with
it. Complex and uncertain challenges require efforts to draw insights
together from across disciplines.}

\section{Supply Chain of Ideas}

\notes{Sustained engagement between government and academia plays an
important role in building mutual understanding about what each can
deliver. Core to Delve’s work was the intention that research
questions be framed in ways that would resonate with the policy
challenges being seen in government.}

\section{Supply Chain of Ideas}

\notes{The main philosphy of the Delve group was to follow the ["Supply Chain of Ideas"](http://inverseprobability.com/talks/notes/coconut-science-and-the-supply-chain-of-ideas.html).}

supply chain of ideas avoids 'coconut science', assuming your
scientific solution is the right one to answer a question that's been
asked. Our science is directed towards policy
questions.}{supply-chain-of-ideas}

\notes{There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but we’re still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed on some of the foundational issues around data use – access, skills, culture – before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI. [link here to data readiness]}

\notes{Delivering a rapid response requires the ability to quickly convene teams from across disciplines (and often institutions) around a key question. To facilitate this, we also used ideas from \addblog{open data science}{2014/07/01/open-data-science} to facilitate communication and understanding.}

\subsection{Conclusions}

\slides{* Bandwidth constraints of humans
* Data as a Convener
* Supply Chain of Ideas
* Recommendations from Delve Data Report}

\notes{The particular circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic have highlighted the challenges of integrating scientific ideas to answer policy questions. In this talk, we've given a formal introduction to the problem, the difficulty of communicating between individuals (particularly from different domains) and reviewed the ideas and solutions we used in the Delve initiative.}

\notes{Recommendations from our most recent report suggest that more effort needs to be placed into working in this manner in normal circumstances, so that when an emergency occurs we are better prepared to deal with the questions we face.}
