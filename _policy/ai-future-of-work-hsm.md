**The AI fallacy**

There is a lot of variation in the use of the term artificial
intelligence. I'm sometimes asked to define it, but depending on whether
you're speaking to a member of the public, a fellow machine learning
researcher, or someone from the business community, the sense of the
term differs.

Underlying its use, I've detected a trend I think of as "The Great AI
Fallacy".

The fallacy is associated with an implicit promise that is embedded in
many statements about Artificial Intelligence. Artificial Intelligence,
as it currently exists, is merely a form of automated decision making.
The implicit promise of Artificial Intelligence is that it will be the
first wave of automation where the machine adapts to the human, rather
than the human adapting to the machine.

Most of what we talk about today as AI is a technology called machine
learning. At its most basic level machine learning is a combination of
data, models and compute to produce a prediction.

The reality is that we haven't yet created machines that are as flexible
as humans, the automation we are producing is still 'fragile', in that
if it encounters unforeseen circumstances it breaks. This is a
consequence of the way we design systems, flexible natural systems such
as ourselves are evolved, not designed. And evolved systems have a first
priority to 'not fail'. What we think of us 'common sense' in the human
is in reality a set of heuristics that prevent us doing stupid things in
the name of achieving a goal. Our AI systems don't exhibit this

Despite this, the AI fallacy is has very real effects on the way we
think about creating and deploying artificial intelligence solutions.
There are serious benefits to society in deploying this new wave of
data-driven automated decision making, but the AI Fallacy is causing us
to suspend our calibrated skepticism that is needed to deploy these
systems safely and efficiently.

**Techno-solutionism and techno-skepticism**

In public discussions about AI, we've seen lots of promises that AI will
save lives, address global challenges such as climate change, and add
trillions of dollars to the global economy and make our daily life
easier and more productive. There are also warnings about killer robots,
job losses and the machines rising up. These portrayals play into a long
history we have of hopes and fears around intelligent machines and our
place in the world. Neither outcome is inevitable.

*Quote from [JM Royal Society
blog](https://royalsociety.org/blog/2018/09/the-impact-of-ai-on-work/):
While much of the public and policy debate about AI and work has tended
to oscillate between fears of the 'end of work' and reassurances that
little will change in terms of overall employment, evidence suggests
that neither of these extremes is likely. However, there is consensus
that AI will have a disruptive effect on work, with some jobs being
lost, others being created, and others changing.*

We can look to history for insights into how AI technologies might
affect our work in the decades to come. Studies from the industrial
revolution to the introduction of the computer to the modern workplace
show us that there is often a lag from technology invention to
widespread economic and social benefit, as individuals and organisations
adopt and adapt to the new ways of working that technologies allow, and
there is often disruption for some groups, sectors or places, with these
disruptions tending to have a bigger impact on already vulnerable
communities.

While technological advances have ignited recent debates about the
future of work, what AI is technically able to automate is only one
factor that contributes to the impact of AI on businesses and
organisations. Political, economic, cultural and organisational
influences all play a role -- and decision-makers across organisations
have the ability to influence how AI will affect them, through
identifying how they can adopt AI, introducing technologies in ways that
work well for human users, and supporting their workforce.

**Organisational data readiness**

[A recent
report](https://rs-delve.github.io/addenda/2020/11/24/organizational-data-maturity.html#data-maturity-assessments)
by the DELVE Initiative considered what action organisations needed to
take to ensure they had the absorptive capacity to begin to make use of
data-enabled technologies like machine learning. A first step is
considering organisational data maturity.

In that report, we noted that "*Many organisations aspire to be data
driven in their decision making, but are held back from achieving this
goal by issues arising from the accessibility and availability of data
between teams or collaborators. Data maturity frameworks can provide
practical guidance for organisations seeking to improve their data
management practices and create value from the data they hold."*

Our proposed framework for data maturity encourages leaders to
interrogate the extent to which businesses are able to deploy data in
their work and to consider what action needs to be taken to support data
science projects.

  **Maturity Level**             **Data Sharing**
  ------------------------------ ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **1** Reactive                 Data sharing is not possible or ad-hoc at best.
  **2**Repeatable                Some limited data service provision is possible and expected, in particular between neighboring teams. Some limited data provision to distinct teams may also be possible
  **3** Managed and Integrated   Data is available through published APIs; corrections to requested data are monitored and API service quality is discussed within the team. Data security protocols are partially automated ensuring electronic access for the data is possible.
  **4**Optimized                 Teams provide reliable data services to other teams. The security and privacy implications of data sharing are automatically handled through privacy and security aware ecosystems.
  **5**Transparent               Internal organizational data is available to external organizations with appropriate privacy and security policies. Decision making across the organisation is data-enabled, with transparent metrics that could be audited through organisational data logs. If appropriate governance frameworks are agreed, data dependent services (including AI systems) could be rapidly and securely redeployed on company data in the service of national emergencies.

Failure to understand the importance of data quality leads to
unrealistic projects staffed by people with the wrong skill sets.
Implementation of a machine learning model can be relatively trivial.
But preparation of the data set and the data ecosystem around the model
is extremely difficult. Without understanding data quality, there's a
risk that the wrong investments are made -- millions spent on recruiting
machine learning PhDs and minimal spend on data infrastructure and
systems for data auditing -- and the resulting systems poorly serve
organisations or employees.

We can track this back to the AI Fallacy -- that AI business problems
will be solved by just adding some algorithms created by a wave of
magician-data-scientists.

Leaders need to avoid a suspension of normal business skepticism where
AI is concerned. If these systems were really 'intelligent', in the way
a human is intelligent, plus if they had the skills of a computer, that
really would be revolutionary. However, that's not what's happening, and
won't happen in the foreseeable future (i.e. on timelines that matter to
business). In reality this is an evolution of existing technology, and
it has the usual challenges of adoption that existing technologies have.
The challenge for decision makers is how to assimilate the implications
of this new technology within their business skill set. Senior business
leaders need to take time out working closely with the technology in
their own environments to better calibrate their understanding of its
strengths and weaknesses.
