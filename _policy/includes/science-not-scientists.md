\notes{The football pundit and former Wales International Robbie Savage is passionate about grassroots football. He has managed youth teams. Robbie's son also plays at a junior level, following his Dad's footsteps at Manchester United's academy. On occasion I've heard Robbie on podcasts talking about his son's fledgling career. In Robbie's voice you can hear the hopes and concerns that every parent has for their own child as they begin to make their way in the world.}

\notes{My son does not play for Manchester United (anyway, he'd prefer to play for Sheffield United) but watching him play Sunday league, I'm aware that I'm not objective about his play, and I'm aware that the parents around me are also not objective. Over my life, my son has played in four different teams with five different managers. And most of these managers also have also had a child playing in the team.}

\notes{This makes watching him play different from watching another team. The parents' presence means that grassroots football is subjective in a particular way. Every parent has an interest in how their child is performing. Different parents have different levels of awareness of this subjectivity, some play down their children's contribuion, others play it up.}

\notes{Scientists are similar to the parents watching their children play grassroots football. Most scientists have a particular field, a particular domain and a particular pet idea. As a result, we should be skeptical about their individual claims, just as we might be more skeptical about a parent's report of their own child's performance. Parents and scientists are people, some of them are more self aware and are better at dealing with this subjectivity, but the truth remains that science isn't scientists.}

\slides{* Just because "scientists say" it doesn't mean "science says".
* Decisions are still needed when facing uncertainty.}

\notes{Scientists are a group of people with particular subjective biases, and their individual opinion may count for a lot within their domain of expertise, but when multidisciplinary questions of policy are in play, then their individual opinions should be treated with some skepticism.}

\notes{The process of *science* involves scientists but it also involves mechanisms that include peer review and debate. Importantly it also includes referees in the form of statisticians, who are trained to treat data subjectively.}

\notes{Science itself is also not *policy*. Policy decisions often have some urgency which means the normal processes of scientific proof do not have time to take their course. These decisions are often about balancing long term versus short term uncertainties.}

\notes{See for example this }\addblog{Primer on Decision Making with Uncertainty}{2020/08/25/a-primer-on-decision-making-with-uncertainty}\notes{.}

\notes{In the moment of policy crisis such as what we've seen in Covid-19 it also has people who are used to keeping the score. Public health professionals are experienced in disease interventions. Many of them having seen how scientific ideas pan out in practice, which turn out to be successful and which sound promising but repeatedly fail to deliver.}

\notes{Kahneman refers to our awe of theory as *theory induces blindness* [@Kahneman:fastslow11], but I feel a more appropriate phrase is *model-induced blindness*.}
