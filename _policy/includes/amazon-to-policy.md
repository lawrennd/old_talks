\subsection{From Amazon to Policy}

\slides{* Amazon lessons apply in policy.
* Pandemic advice, DELVE group.}
\notes{Many of the lessons I learned from the Amazon experience have also proved useful in policy advice. At the outbreak of the pandemic, the Royal Society convened a group of ["data science experts" to give scientific advice](https://rs-delve.github.io/). This group fed into SAGE via the Royal Society's then president, Venki Ramakrishnan. But it also worked closely with Government departments (as required) to better understand the challenges they were facing and ensure that its policy advice was tailored to the problems at hand.}

\notes{In Amazon's case, institutional structure changed to reflect the information infrastructure. In the long term, cultural changes are likely across any institution that wants to level-up in terms of its data driven decision making. These instituonal characters will be as varied as those we find in governments, hospitals, Universities and industrial manufacturers. The key question is how to trigger those cultural changes, while preserving the essence of what allows that institution to deliver on its responsibilities. What actions can we take to better understand the steps we need?}

\notes{A major challenge with science advice is that scientists are unused to responding to operational pressures. A large part of my time at Amazon was spent in the supply chain. Within that, what I refer to as operational science, the best available answer was needed at the moment of decision. Many scientists struggle to operate while events are unfolding. The best examples I've seen of this being done in practice were at Amazon, during the weekly business reviews. These meetings looked at the status of the global supply of products. Any interventions required to deal with unexpected demand or restricted supply were decided quickly on the basis of the best information available. A different domain where similar skills are displayed is Formula One race strategy. I've worked closely with two of the major F1 teams' strategy groups. Their need for data driven decision making in the moment leads to a very different set of priorities than those you find in the academic community.}

\notes{Policy exhibits significant aspects of this form of operational science. I perceive a gap between our desire to deliver such data driven policy and skill sets required to do this in practice. My best understanding is that this gap tends to be filled with consultants. Short term, this may lead to decisions being made, but long term this is highly problematic as the practice of data driven decision making needs to be tightly integrated with the institution.}

\notes{In summary, my first point is that different institutions have different characters. The institutional character is, at least in part, driven by its information infrastructure. It's the supply chain of information that enables informed decision making. The information must flow from where the data is generated, to those that make the decisions.}
