\subsection{Coin Pusher}

\notes{Disruption of society is like a coin pusher, it's those who are already on the edge who are most likely to be effected by disruption}

\figure{\includejpg{\diagramsDir/policy/Coin_pusher_2}{70%}}{A coin pusher is a game where coins are dropped into th etop of the machine, adn they disrupt those on the existing steps. With any coin drop, many coins move, but it is those on the edge, who are often only indirectly effected, but also most traumatically effected by the change.}{coin-pusher} 

\notes{One danger of the current hyper around ChatGPT is that we are overly focussing on the fact that it seems to have significant effect on professional jobs, people are naturally asking the question "what does it do for my role?". No doubt, there will be disruption, but the coin pusher hypothesis suggests that that disruption will likely involve movement on the same step. However it is those on the edge already, who are often not working directly in the information economy, who often have less of a voice in the policy conversation who are likely to be most disrupted.}
