\subsection{Departmental Planning}

\slides{* Integrate data science in planning.
* At Amazon teams asked to say how they are using machine learning in planning documents.
  * Raises awareness in departments, but can lead to superficial efforts.}

\notes{One technique used at Amazon to rapidly deploy machine learning capability across the company was to ask each team to include a short paragraph on how they are using machine learning in their operational plans. This was effective in ensuring that machine learning was taken into account in strategic planning for those teams.}

\notes{To a large extent this may have already happened, in the last CSR I'm sure it was politically opportune to include plans for spending around e.g. artificial intelligence. But I'd be curious to know to what extent those plans received critical review. Because there's a danger that that funding doesn't influence the culture of the department, but merely creates an additional arm of operations that doesn't interconnect with the wider agenda.}
