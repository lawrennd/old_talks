\section{Case Study: Face Masks}


\include{_delve/includes/delve-overview.md}

\notes{I was involved in the convening of the group. Experience from previous projects suggested that data expertise that was independent of domain knowledge often leads to misdirected efforts. We therefore convened a group that consisted of domain experts (public health, epidemiology, immunology, economics, behavioral economics, statistics, machine learning, education).}

\notes{Early on in the pandemic, it was noticeable that countries with experience of respitory diseases were making extensive use of face coverings in combating the disease.}

Countries with early mask usage tend to have flatter curves even without the use of lockdows. (Figure and caption taken from @Longrich-masks20).}{longrich-sheppard}

\notes{The DELVE group produced a report that assimilated various forms of evidence [@Delve-facemasks20].}

\subsubsection{Breakout}

* As pre-read material, you were provided with a report summary and links to the full report and responses collated by the Science Media Centre.
  * In your groups, discuss the summary and these responses.
* For both the comments and the responses put yourself in the position of a government minister. 
  * What would you do and why? 
  * Which comments and recommendations were helpful and which weren't?
