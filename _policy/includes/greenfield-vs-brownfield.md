\subsection{Greenfield vs Brownfield}

\slides{* What are opportunities for UK in enabling data-driven innovation?
  * Greenfield innovation: entirely new businesses that emerge from the technology.
  * Brownfield innovation: reform and improve existing businesses by integrating technolgy.}

\notes{Stepping back from the pure government context, we can ask "what are the greatest opportunities for the UK in enabling data-driven innovation?" When answering this, I like to separate “greenfield” innovation and “brownfield” innovation. Both are important, but are different in character.}

\notes{*Greenfield innovation*: a previous example of greenfield innovation is the the computer games industry. in the early days of software. A new form of business and company that capitalized on new technology to create new businesses.}

\notes{In the 1980's Robert Solow said: "You can see the computer age everywhere except in the productivity statistics." I see this quote as a consequence of the challenge of *brownfield innovation*. The largest part of the economy will naturally not (at the outset) be the greenfield innovations. The dominant portion of the economy will be existing businesses. Retrofitting the technology into existing businesses. For example, the process of digital transformation is still not complete in supply chain (my team at Amazon focussed on delivering machine learning technology in that domain).}

\notes{There is a massive opportunity for the UK in *brownfield innovation*, but it's easier to talk about greenfield innovation (e.g. how Google does things) regardless of whether those ideas transfer to the institutional characters that we're looking to form.}

\notes{The key challenge/opportunity in data driven decision making is bridging the gap. Overall we require an ecosystem of companies that deliver greenfield innovators that address the challenges of the brownfield domains. We can't afford for there to be such a large gap between e.g. car parts manufacturing in Rotherham and city trading. A similar story plays out at a smaller scale within government. But I suspect the subtleties of this story can be lost in spending plans. The Data Maturity Assessment gives a route to reviewing the extent to which such plans move beyond "fancy words" and translate into the reality of how decisions are being made in a given department.}

\newslide{Retrofitting Infastructure}

\slides{* Imagine retrofitting the flush toilet to a 19th century tenement block.
* Or the work done to transfer from town gas to natural gas: 40 million appliances and 14 million customers.
* Moving to a carbon-neutral energy system.}

\notes{When thinking of brownfield innovation I find it useful to think of the equivalent tasks in physical infrastructure. The retrofitting of 40 million applicances for use with natural gas that took place in the 1960s and 1970s. The current moves to a carbon-neutral energy system. I also give the analogy of the flush toilet.}

\notes{Imagine the challenge of retro-fitting flush toilets to a tenement block (brownfield innovation) vs the challenge of integrating a flush toilet within a new build. In particular imagine that the tenement block has people living in it, and they won't be moving out for the retrofit. There are aspects to this challenge that are infrastructural, and require working out how to put in the plumbing for the building as a whole. But there are other aspects that are personal, and require close-discussion with the families that live in the building.}

\notes{We might expect that in the wider economy traditional businesses will be disrupted by those that exploit the new capabilities, the market driven nature of that economy would imply that they either evolve or die. But even if we believe that's the correct approach in the wider economy, the same approach can not be taken in our schools, hopsitals, governments and Universities.}

\notes{The data maturity assessments give a sense of the scale of the need for the infrastructure, and what might be needed in terms of close interaction with individual departments, teams or groups. The data science champions provide a mechanism to get a more qualitative understanding of the challenges within the different sub-domains and ensure that the facilities can be fitted with the minimal disruption, and when fitted will be properly used.}
