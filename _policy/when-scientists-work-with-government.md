title: When Scientists Work with Government
venue: The Leader's Institute Interview
reveal: False
abstract: |
  - The Delve initiative is a group that was convened by the Royal
    Society to help provide data-driven insights about the pandemic,
    with an initial focus on exiting the first lockdown and particular
    interest in using the variation of strategies across different
    international governments to inform policy.

  - Drawing from a multidisciplinary team of domain experts in policy,
    public health, economics, education, immunology, epidemiology, and
    social science, alongside statisticians, mathematicians, computer
    scientists and machine learning scientists, DELVE set out to provide
    advice and analysis that could feed into live policy decisions.

  - The main philosophy of the Delve group was to follow the "Supply
    Chain of Ideas", connecting scientific evidence to policy questions.

\section{Lessons Learned}

\subsection{Multidisciplinarity and uncertainty}

-   The response needed for policy questions is complex and uncertain.
    It requires a multi-disciplinary response. 

-   Multidisciplinarity brings challenges and opportunities. Among the
    challenges are the issues with different nomenclature for related
    technical ideas. The use of jargon in specific fields, and
    assumptions around what is canoncical knowledge vs what specifics
    need to be elucidated.

-   The solution for these challenges is a motto: there are no stupid
    questions. Each member of the Action Team has been selected for
    their talents, they should never feel embarassed to ask for
    clarification or deeper understanding from another member of the
    team. Naturally, a consequence of this is each member of the team
    should be prepared to explain their ideas to others clearly, and
    using different terminologies.

-   A bear-trap is assumption by intimidation. The idea that because
    someone is technically expert, that they can't make a foolish error.
    In fact, the opposite is often true, by being too focussed on a
    specific technical idea, we can all miss something that is obvious
    to those who don't have our individual deep technical understanding.
    The DELVE aim was to do our very best to avoid this bear-trap.

\subsection{Convening}

-   Policy decisions often have some urgency which means the normal
    processes of scientific proof do not have time to take their course.
    These decisions are often about balancing long term versus short
    term uncertainties.

-   Delivering a rapid response requires the ability to quickly convene
    teams from across disciplines (and often institutions) around a key
    question. 

-   Right from the start the, data was at the heart of what DELVE does,
    but the reality is that little can be done without domain expertise
    and often the data we required wasn't available. However, even when
    it is not present, the notion of what data might be needed can also
    have a convening effect, bringing together multiple disciplines
    around the policy questions at hand. 

-   Recommendations from our most recent report suggest that more effort
    needs to be placed into working in this manner in normal
    circumstances, so that when an emergency occurs we are better
    prepared to deal with the questions we face.

\section{What you would do differently or change}

There is lots of hope for the role data science and AI could play, but
we're still a way off from being AI-ready. Further attention is needed
on some of the foundational issues around data use -- access, skills,
culture -- before we can begin to talk in earnest about deploying AI.

A recent report on data readiness for emergencies made recommendations
aiming to improve the UK's ability to use insights from data science to
respond rapidly and effectively to national crises. These included:

-   Government should update the statutory objective of the Office for
    National Statistics (ONS) to accommodate trustworthy access to
    happenstance data to generate national and local statistics. Such
    statistics are required on very short time frames to facilitate
    fast decision-making for the nation in the rapidly evolving
    circumstances of a national emergency.

-   The ONS should collaborate closely with the Information
    Commissioner's Office (ICO) to formulate a standardized
    qualification for data access, equivalent to a 'data driving
    license' that would demonstrate trustworthiness and ensure that
    qualified experts can get rapid access to different data types
    with the appropriate standardized ethical and legal training in
    place.

-   Government should fund interdisciplinary pathfinder data projects.
    These projects should require collaborations between industries,
    run across government departments and integrate different academic
    expertise. Each project should target a specific policy question.
    Beyond the pathfinder role, the projects will leave a legacy in
    the form of expertise and guidance in understanding the stages of
    the data-sharing pipeline. Priority areas for pathfinder projects
    include:

    -   Nowcasting of economic metrics

    -   Mobility data
