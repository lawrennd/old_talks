title: "Science, Evidence and Government; Reflections on the Covid-19 Experience"
abstract: >
  This high-profile event brings together four senior academics from
  across the University of Cambridge who have all been advising
  policy-makers during the Covid-19 pandemic.

  The speakers will draw on their extensive experience of advising and
  being consulted by policy-makers, and will reflect on some of the
  lessons, debates and controversies associated with governmental
  responses to the pandemic. And they will consider what this episode
  tells us about the relationship between science, evidence and public
  policy in times of crisis.
