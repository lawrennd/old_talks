  publisher =	 cup,
  year =	 2011,
  editor =	 {David Barber and A. Taylan Cemgil and Silvia
                  Chiappa},
  abstract =	 {'What's going to happen next?' Time series data hold
                  the answers, and Bayesian methods represent the
                  cutting edge in learning what they have to say. This
                  ambitious book is the first unified treatment of the
                  emerging knowledge-base in Bayesian time series
                  techniques.  Exploiting the unifying framework of
                  probabilistic graphical models, the book covers
                  approximation schemes, both Monte Carlo and
                  deterministic, and introduces switching,
                  multi-object, non-parametric and agent-based models
                  in a variety of application environments. It
                  demonstrates that the basic framework supports the
                  rapid creation of models tailored to specific
                  applications and gives insight into the
                  computational complexity of their
                  implementation. The authors span traditional
                  disciplines such as statistics and engineering and
                  the more recently established areas of machine
                  learning and pattern recognition. Readers with a
                  basic understanding of applied probability, but no
                  experience with time series analysis, are guided
                  from fundamental concepts to the state-of-the-art in
                  research and practice.},

  abstract ={A vital perspective is missing from the discussions we're having about Artificial Intelligence: what does it mean for our identity?

Our fascination with AI stems from the perceived uniqueness of human intelligence. We believe it's what differentiates us. Fears of AI not only concern how it invades our digital lives, but also the implied threat of an intelligence that displaces us from our position at the centre of the world.

Neil D. Lawrence's visionary book shows why these fears may be misplaced. Atomism, proposed by Democritus, suggested it was impossible to continue dividing matter down into ever smaller components: eventually we reach a point where a cut cannot be made (the Greek for uncuttable is 'atom'). In the same way, by slicing away at the facets of human intelligence that can be replaced by machines, AI uncovers what is left: an indivisible core that is the essence of humanity.

By contrasting our own (evolved, locked-in, embodied) intelligence with the capabilities of machine intelligence through history, The Atomic Human reveals the technical origins, capabilities and limitations of AI systems, and how they should be wielded. Not just by the experts, but ordinary people. Either AI is a tool for us, or we become a tool of AI. Understanding this will enable readers to choose the future we want.}

                  algorithms that uncover the structure and

                  model---in other words, to answer specific questions
                  about the underlying mechanisms of a biological
                  system---in a process that can be thought of as
                  learning or inference. This volume offers
                  state-of-the-art perspectives from computational
                  biology, statistics, modeling, and machine learning
                  on new methodologies for learning and inference in
                  biological networks.  The chapters offer practical
                  approaches to biological inference problems ranging
                  from genome-wide inference of genetic regulation to
                  pathway-specific studies. Both deterministic models
                  (based on ordinary differential equations) and
                  stochastic models (which anticipate the increasing
                  availability of data from small populations of
                  cells) are considered.  Several chapters emphasize
                  Bayesian inference, so the editors have included an
                  introduction to the philosophy of the Bayesian
                  approach and an overview of current work on Bayesian
                  inference. Taken together, the methods discussed by
                  the experts in Learning and Inference in
                  Computational Systems Biology provide a foundation
                  upon which the next decade of research in systems
                  biology can be built.},

  abstract =	 {Dataset shift is a common problem in predictive
                  modeling that occurs when the joint distribution of
                  inputs and outputs differs between training and test
                  stages. Covariate shift, a particular case of
                  dataset shift, occurs when only the input
                  distribution changes. Dataset shift is present in
                  most practical applications, for reasons ranging
                  from the bias introduced by experimental design to
                  the irreproducibility of the testing conditions at
                  training time. (An example is -email spam filtering,
                  which may fail to recognize spam that differs in
                  form from the spam the automatic filter has been
                  built on.) Despite this, and despite the attention
                  given to the apparently similar problems of
                  semi-supervised learning and active learning,
                  dataset shift has received relatively little
                  attention in the machine learning community until
                  recently. This volume offers an overview of current
                  efforts to deal with dataset and covariate
                  shift.\\\\ The chapters offer a mathematical and
                  philosophical introduction to the problem, place
                  dataset shift in relationship to transfer learning,
                  transduction, local learning, active learning, and
                  semi-supervised learning, provide theoretical views
                  of dataset and covariate shift (including decision
                  theoretic and Bayesian perspectives), and present
                  algorithms for covariate shift.},

                  practical, probabilistic approach to learning in
                  kernel machines. GPs have received increased
                  attention in the machine-learning community over the
                  past decase, and this book provides a long-needed
                  systematic and unified treatment of theoretical and
                  practical aspects of GPs in machine learning.  The
                  treatment is comprehensive and self-contained,
                  targetd at researchers and students in machine
                  learning and applied statistics.\\\\ The book deals
                  with the supervised-learning problem for both
                  regression and classification, and includes detailed
                  algorithms. A wide variety of covariance (kernel)
                  functions are presented and their properties
                  discussed. Model selection is discussed both from a
                  Bayesian and a classical perspective. Many
                  connections to other well known techniques from
                  machine learning and statistics are discussed,
                  including support-vector machines, neural networks,
                  splines, regularization networks, relevance vector
                  machines, and others. Theoretical issues including
                  learning curves and the PAC-Bayesian framework are
                  treated, and several approximation methods for
                  learning with large datasets are discussed. The book
                  contains illustrative examples and exercises, and
                  code and datasets are available on the
                  Web. Appendixes provide mathematical background and
                  a discussion of Gaussian Markov processes.},
