title: "Machine Learning and Data Science"
subtitle: "Data First Design"
abstract: >
  Machine learning solutions, in particular those based on deep
  learning methods, form an underpinning of the current revolution in
  “artificial intelligence” that has dominated popular press headlines
  and is having a significant influence on the wider tech agenda.
  
  In this talk I will give an overview of where we are now with
  machine learning solutions, and what challenges we face both in the
  near and far future. These include practical application of existing
  algorithms in the face of the need to explain decision making,
  mechanisms for improving the quality and availability of data,
  dealing with large unstructured datasets.

\notes{We can characterize the challenges for integrating machine learning within our systems as the three Ds. Decomposition, Data and Deployment.}

\notes{The first two components *decomposition* and *data* are interlinked, but we will first outline the decomposition challenge. Below we will mainly focus on *supervised learning* because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.}
