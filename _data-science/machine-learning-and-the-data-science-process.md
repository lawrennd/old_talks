### Machine Learning

$$ \text{data} + \text{model} \xrightarrow{\text{compute}} \text{prediction}$$

### Machine Learning

* Normal ML (& stats?) focus: model

* In real world need more focus on: data

* motivation for data science

### Background: Big Data

* The pervasiveness of data brings forward particular challenges.

* Emerging themes: Devolving compute onto device. 

* Data preprocessing: Internet of Intelligence.

\include{_data-science/includes/evolved-relationship.md}

### Effects

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* What does it mean for IoT

### Internet of People

* Fog computing: barrier between cloud and device blurring.
    * Computing on the Edge

* Stuxnet: Adversarial and Security implications for intelligent systems.

* Complex feedback between algorithm and implementation
  

### Challenges

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalisation

4. Deploying AI in the real world.

4. Deploying AI in the real world.


### Quantifying the Value of Data

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!


### Data --- Quotes from NIPS Workshop on ML for Healthcare

* 90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony Celi)
* "The Dirty Work We Don't Want to Think About" (Eric Xing)
* "Voodoo to get it decompressed" (Francisco Giminez)
* In health care clinicians collect the data and often control the direction of research through guardianship of data.

### Value

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
    * Incentivization for sharing and production.
    * Quantifying the value in the contribution of *each actor*.

### Conclusion

* Data science offers a great deal of promise for personalized health
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**

* There are particular challenges around the Internet of Intelligence.
