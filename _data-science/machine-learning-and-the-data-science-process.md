\newslide{Machine Learning}

$$ \text{data} + \text{model} \stackrel{\text{compute}}{\rightarrow} \text{prediction}$$

\newslide{Machine Learning}

* Normal ML (& stats?) focus: model

* In real world need more focus on: data

* motivation for data science

\newslide{Background: Big Data}

* The pervasiveness of data brings forward particular challenges.

* Emerging themes: Devolving compute onto device. 

* Data preprocessing: Internet of Intelligence.

\newslide{Effects}

* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.

* Large scale data acquisition and distribution.

* What does it mean for IoT

\newslide{Internet of People}

* Fog computing: barrier between cloud and device blurring.
    * Computing on the Edge

* Stuxnet: Adversarial and Security implications for intelligent systems.

* Complex feedback between algorithm and implementation
  

\newslide{Challenges}

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society

2. Quantifying the Value of Data

3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalisation

4. Deploying AI in the real world.

\newslide{Quantifying the Value of Data}

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!


\newslide{Data --- Quotes from NIPS Workshop on ML for Healthcare}

* 90% of our time is spent on validation and integration (Leo Anthony Celi)
* "The Dirty Work We Don't Want to Think About" (Eric Xing)
* "Voodoo to get it decompressed" (Francisco Giminez)
* In health care clinicians collect the data and often control the direction of research through guardianship of data.

\newslide{Value}

* How do we measure value in the data economy?
* How do we encourage data workers: curation and management
    * Incentivization for sharing and production.
    * Quantifying the value in the contribution of *each actor*.

\newslide{Conclusion}

* Data science offers a great deal of promise for personalized health
* There are challenges and pitfalls
* It is incumbent on us to avoid them

**Many solutions rely on education and awareness**

* There are particular challenges around the Internet of Intelligence.
