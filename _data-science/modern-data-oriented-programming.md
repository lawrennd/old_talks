title: "Modern Data Oriented Programming"
abstract: >

  There has been a great deal of interest in probabilistic programs:
  placing modeling at the heart of programming language. In this talk
  we set the scene for data oriented programming.
  
  Data is a fundamental component of machine learning, yet the
  availability, quality and discoverability of data are often ignored
  in formal computer science.
  
  While languages for data manipulation exist (for example SQL), they
  are not suitable for the modern world of machine learning
  data. Modern data oriented languages should place data at the center
  of modern digital systems design and provide an infrastructure in
  which monitoring of data quality and model decision making are
  automaticaly available.
  
  We provide the context for Modern Data Oriented Programming, and
  give some insight into our initial ideas in this space.

* These are interpretable models: vital for disease etc.

* Modern machine learning methods are less interpretable

* Example: face recognition

\notes{The first two components *decomposition* and *data* are interlinked, but we will first outline the decomposition challenge. Below we will mainly focus on *supervised learning* because this is arguably the technology that is best understood within machine learning.}
