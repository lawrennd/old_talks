* This phenomenon has already revolutionised biology.
    * Large scale data acquisition and distribution.
    * Transcriptomics, genomics, epigenomics, 'rich phenomics'.
* Great *promise* for personalized health.
}

\notes{We have already seen the effects of this changed dynamic in biology and computational biology. Improved sensorics have led to the new domains of transcriptomics, epigenomics, and 'rich phenomics' as well as considerably augmenting our capabilities in genomics.} 

\notes{Biologists have had to become data-savvy, they require a rich understanding of the available data resources and need to assimilate existing data sets in their hypothesis generation as well as their experimental design. Modern biology has become a far more quantitative science, but the quantitativeness has required new methods developed in the domains of *computational biology* and *bioinformatics*.}

\notes{There is also great promise for personalized health, but in health the wide data-sharing that has underpinned success in the computational biology community is much harder to carry out.}

* Automated decision making within the computer based only on the data.
* Subjective biases need to be better understood.
* Particularly important where treatments are being prescribed.
    * Interventions could be far more subtle.
}

\notes{We can expect to see these phenomena reflected in wider society. Particularly as we make use of more automated decision making based only on data. This is leading to a requirement to better understand our own subjective biases to ensure that the human to computer interface allows domain experts to assimilate data driven conclusions in a well calibrated manner. This is particularly important where medical treatments are being prescribed. It also offers potential for different kinds of medical intervention. More subtle interventions are possible when the digital environment is able to respond to users in an bespoke manner. This has particular implications for treatment of mental health conditions.}

* Shift in dynamic:
    * from direct human-data to indirect human-computer-data
    * modern data analysis is mediated by the machine
* This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of data science
}

\notes{The main phenomenon we see across the board is the shift in dynamic from the direct pathway between human and data, as traditionally mediated by classical statistics, to a new flow of information via the computer. This change of dynamics gives us the modern and emerging domain of *data science*, where the interactions between human and data are mediated by the machine.}
