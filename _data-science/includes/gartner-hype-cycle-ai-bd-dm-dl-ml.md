\notes{Examining Google trends search for 'artificial intelligence', 'big data', 'data mining', 'deep learning' and 'machine learning' we can see that 'artificial intelligence' *may* be entering a plateau of productivity, 'big data' is entering the trough of disillusionment, and 'data mining' seems to be deeply within the trough. On the other hand, 'deep learning' and 'machine learning' appear to be ascending to the peak of inflated expectations having experienced a technology trigger.}

\notes{For deep learning that technology trigger was the ImageNet result of 2012 [@Krizhevsky:imagenet12]. This step change in performance on object detection in images was achieved through convolutional neural networks, popularly known as 'deep learning'.}
