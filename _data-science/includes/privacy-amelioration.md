\notes{Addressing challenges in privacy, loss of control and marginalization includes ensuring that the individual retains control of their own data. We accept privacy in our real loves, we need to accept it in our digital persona. This is vital for our control of persona and our ability to project ourselves.}

\notes{Fairness goes hand in hand with privacy to protect the individual. Regulations like the GDPR date from a time where the main worry was *consequential* decision making but today we also face problems from accumulation of inconsequential decisions leading to a resulting consequential effect.}

\notes{Capacity building in different contexts, empowering domain experts to solve their own problems, is one aspect to the solution. A further proposal is the use of data trusts to reintroduce control of personal data for the individual.}
