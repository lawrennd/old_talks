\subsection{Conclusion}
\slides{
* Challenges in *design*, *data curation* and *model deployment* for ML.
* Data oriented architectures and data first thinking are the solution.
* Data oriented programming creates systems that are ready to deploy.
* Opens the door to auto-adaptive ML and information dynamics analysis.

\notes{We operate in a technologically evolving environment.  Machine learning is becoming a key coponent in our decision making capabilities, our intelligence and strategic command. However, technology drove changes in battlefield strategy. From the stalemate of the first world war to the tank-dominated Blitzkrieg of the second, to the asymmetric warfare of the present. Our technology, tactics and strategies are also constantly evolving. Machine learning is part of that evolution solution, but the main challenge is not to become so fixated on the tactics of today that we miss the evolution of strategy that the technology is suggesting.

Data oriented programming offers a set of development methodologies which ensure that the system designer considers what decisions are required, how they will be made, and critically, declares this within the system architecture.

This allows for monitoring of *data quality*, *fairness*, *model accuracy* and opens the door to a more sophisticated form of auto ML where full redployments of models are considered while analyzing the information dynamics of a complex automated decision making system.
