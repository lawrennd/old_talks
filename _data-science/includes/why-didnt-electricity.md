\notes{There are parallels between the deployment of machine learning solutions and update as electricity as a means of powering industry. Tim Harford explores the reasons why it took time to exploit the power of electricity in the manufacturing industry. The true benefit of electricity came when machinery had electric motors incorporated. Substituting a centralized steam engine in a manufacturing plant with a centralized electric motor didn't reduce costs or improve the reconfigurability of a factory. The real advantages came when the belt drives that were necessary to redistribute power were replaced with electric cables and energy was transformed into motion at the machine rather than centrally. This gives a manufacturing plant reconfigurability.

We can expect to see the same thing with our machine learning capabilities. In the analogy our existing software systems are the steam power, and data driven systems are equivalent to electricity. Currently software engineers create information processing entities (programs) in a centralized manner, where as data driven systems are reactive and responsive to their environment. Just as with electricity this brings new flexibility to our systems, but new dangers as well.}
