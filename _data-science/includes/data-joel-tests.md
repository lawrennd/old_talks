\section{Assessing the Organizations Readiness}

\notes{Assessing the readiness of data for analysis is one action that can be taken, but assessing teams that need to assimilate the information in the data is the other side of the coin. With this in mind both [Damon Civin](https://medium.com/@damoncivin/the-joel-test-for-data-readiness-4882aae64753) and [Nick Elprin](https://blog.dominodatalab.com/joel-test-data-science/) have independently proposed the idea of a "Data Joel Test". A "[Joel Test](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/)" is a short questionnaire to establish the ability of a team to handle software engineering tasks. It is designed as a rough and ready capability assessment. A "Data Joel Test" is similar, but for assessing the capability of a team in performing data science. }
