\section{Quantifying the Value of Data}

\notes{The situation is reminiscent of a thirsty castaway, set adrift. There is a sea of data, but it is not fit to drink. We need some form of data desalination before it can be consumed. But like real desalination, this is a non-trivial process, particularly if we want to achieve it at scale.}

There's a sea of data, but most of it is undrinkable.

We require data-desalination before it can be consumed!

\notes{I spoke about the challenges in data science at the NIPS 2016 Workshop on Machine Learning for Health. NIPS mainly focuses on machine learning methodologies, and many of the speakers were doing so. But before my talk, I listened to some of the other speakers talk about the challenges they had with data preparation.}
