### The Software Crisis

>The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have
>become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite
>bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem
>at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild
>problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an
>equally gigantic problem.

### The Data Crisis

>The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more
>interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but
>data quality is often poor. What we need is cheap high quality
>data. That implies that we develop processes for improving and
>verifying data quality that are efficient.
>
>There would seem to be two ways for improving efficiency. Firstly, we
>should not duplicate work. Secondly, where possible we should automate
>work.
