\subsection{Data Selective Attention Bias}

\notes{We are going to see how inattention biases can play out in data analysis by going through a simple example. The analysis involves body mass index and activity information.}

\subsection{A Hypothesis as a Liability}

\notes{This analysis is from an article titled "A Hypothesis as a Liability" [@Yanai-hypothesis20], they start their article with the following quite from Herman Hesse.}

>“ ‘When someone seeks,’ said Siddhartha, ‘then it easily happens that his eyes see only the thing that he seeks, and he is able to find nothing, to take in nothing. [...] Seeking means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal.’ ”
>
> Hermann Hesse

\notes{Their idea is that having a hypothesis can constrain our thinking. However, in answer to their paper @Felin-data20 argue that some form of hypothesis is always necessary, suggesting that a hypothesis *can* be a liability}


\newslide{The Scientific Process}

\notes{My view is captured in the introductory chapter to an edited volume on computational systems biology that I worked on with Mark Girolami, Magnus Rattray and Guido Sanguinetti.}

\notes{Popper nicely captures the interaction between hypothesis and data by relating it to the chicken and the egg. The important thing is that these two co-evolve.}
