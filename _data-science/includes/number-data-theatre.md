\subsection{Number Theatre}

\notes{Unfortunately, we don't always have time to wait for this process to converge to an answer we can all rely on before a decision is required.}

\notes{Not only can we be misled by data before a decision is made, but sometimes we can be misled by data to justify the making of a decision. David Spiegelhalter refers to the phenomenon of "Number Theatre" in a conversation with Andrew Marr from May 2020 on the presentation of data.}

\subsection{Data Theatre}

\notes{Data Theatre exploits data inattention bias to present a particular view on events that may misrepresents through selective presentation. Statisticians are one of the few groups that are trained with a sufficient degree of data skepticism. But it can also be combatted through ensuring there are domain experts present, and that they can speak freely.}
