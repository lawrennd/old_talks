\subsection{Fynesse Template}

\figure{\includepng{\diagramsDir/data-science/fynnesse-template}{60%}}{The Fynesse Template gives you a starting point for building your data science library. You can fork the template, and then create a new repository from the template. You can use that repository for your analysis.}{fynesse-template}


\notes{To help you think about the aspects of the Fynesse data science framework, we've created a small github template that's available [here](https://github.com/lawrennd/fynesse_template). We suggest the following approach to using the template. Firstly: *fork the template* to your own github account. Then you can base your analysis software on the template. If there are aspects to the template that you think need updating (including things you don't like!), then you can update those and submit a pull request so that others can benefit.}

\notes{Github makes it easy to create a new repository from this framework. Although you should feel free to use your own tools for source code control if you find them more convenient.}
