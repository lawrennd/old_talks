\subsection{The Big Data Paradox}

\slides{* We collect more data, but we understand less.}

\notes{The big data paradox is the modern phenomenon of "as we collect more data, we understand less". It is emerging in several domains, political polling, characterization of patients for trials data, monitoring twitter for political sentiment.}

\notes{I like to think of the phenomenon as relating to the notion of "can't see the wood for the trees". Classical statistics, with randomized controlled trials, improved society's understanding of data. It improved our ability to monitor the forest, to consider population health, voting patterns etc. It is critically dependent on active approaches to data collection that deal with confounders. This data collection can be very expensive.}

\notes{In business today, it is still the gold standard, A/B tests are used to understand the effect of an intervention on revenue or customer capture or supply chain costs.}

\notes{The new phenomenon is *happenstance data*. Data that is not actively collected with a question in mind. As a result, it can mislead us. For example, if we assume the politics of active users of twitter is reflective of the wider population's politics, then we may be misled.}

\notes{However, this happenstance data often allows us to characterise a particular individual to a high degree of accuracy. Classical statistics was all about the forest, but big data can often become about the individual tree. As a result we are misled about the situation.}

\notes{The phenomenon is more dangerous, because our perception is that we are characterizing the wider scenario with ever increasing accuracy. Whereas we are just becoming distracted by detail that may or may not be pertinent to the wider situation.}

\notes{This is related to our limited bandwidth as humans, and the ease with which we are distracted by detail. The data-inattention-cognitive-bias.}
