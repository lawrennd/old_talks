\subsection{Challenges}



\notes{The field of data science is rapidly evolving. Different practitioners from different domains have their own perspectives. We identify three broad challenges that are emerging. Challenges which have not been addressed in the traditional sub-domains of data science. The challenges have social implications but require technological advance for their solutions.}

1. Paradoxes of the Data Society
2. Quantifying the Value of Data
3. Privacy, loss of control, marginalization
