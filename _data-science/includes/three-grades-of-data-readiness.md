\subsubsection{Three Grades of Data Readiness}

\notes{Data-readiness describes, at its coarsest level,  three separate stages of data graduation.}

* Grade C - accessibility
  * Transition: data becomes electronically available 
* Grade B - validity
  * Transition: pose a question to the data.
* Grade A - usability

\notes{The important definitions are at the transition. The move from Grade C data to Grade B data is delimited by the *electronic availability* of the data. The move from Grade B to Grade A data is delimited by posing a question or task to the data [@Lawrence-drl17]. }
