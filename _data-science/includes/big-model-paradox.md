\subsection{Big Model Paradox}

\notes{The big data paradox has a sister: the big model paradox. As we build more and more complex models, we start believing that we have a high-fidelity representation of reality. But the complexity of reality is way beyond our feeble imaginings. So we end up with a highly complex model, but one that falls well short in terms of reflecting reality. The complexity of the model means that it moves beyond our understanding. }

\slides{* Add complexity to the model to make it realistic.
* Move model "beyond human intuition"
* But model still falls well short of mark in terms of representing reality}
