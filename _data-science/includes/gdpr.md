* Reflection on data eco-systems.

* GDPR: Good Data Practice Rules

* When viewed as best practice rather than regulation they hightlight problems in data ecosystems.}

\notes{Early reactions to the General Data Protection Regulation by companies seem to have been fairly wary, but if we view the principles outlined in the GDPR as good practice, rather than regulation, it feels like companies can only improve their internal data ecosystems by conforming to the GDPR. For this reason, I like to think of the initials as standing for "Good Data Practice Rules" rather than General Data Protection Regulation. In particular, the term "data protection" is a misnomer, and indeed the earliest [data protection directive from the EU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_for_the_protection_of_individuals_with_regard_to_automatic_processing_of_personal_data) (from 1981) refers to the protection of *individuals* with regard to the automatic processing of personal data, which is a much better sense of the term. 

If we think of the legislation as protecting individuals, and we note that it seeks, and instead of viewing it as regulation, we view it as "Wouldn't it be good if ...", e.g. in respect to the ["right to an explanation"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right_to_explanation), we might suggest: "Wouldn't it be good if we could explain why our automated decision making system made a particular decison". That seems like good practice for an organization's automated decision making systems.

Similarly, with regard to data minimization principles. Retaing the minimum amount of personal data needed to drive decisions could well lead to *better* decision making as it causes us to become intentional about which data is used rather than the sloppier thinking that "more is better" encourages. Particularly when we consider that to be truly useful data has to be cleaned and maintained.

If GDPR is truly reflecting the interests of individuals, then it is also reflecting the interests of consumers, patients, users etc, each of whom make use of these systems. For any company that is customer facing, or any service that prides itself on the quality of its delivery to those individuals, "good data practice" should become part of the DNA of the organization.}
