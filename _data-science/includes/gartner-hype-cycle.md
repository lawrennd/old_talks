\subsection{The Gartner Hype Cycle}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/Gartner_Hype_Cycle}{80%}}{The Gartner Hype Cycle places technologies on a graph that relates to the expectations we have of a technology against its actual influence. Early hope for a new techology is often displaced by disillusionment due to the time it takes for a technology to be usefully deployed.}{gartner-hype-cycle}

\notes{
The [Gartner Hype Cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle) tries to assess where an idea is in terms of maturity and adoption. It splits the evolution of technology into a technological trigger, a peak of expectations followed by a trough of disillusionment and a final ascension into a useful technology. It looks rather like a classical control response to a final set point.
