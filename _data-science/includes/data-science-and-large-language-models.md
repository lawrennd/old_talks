\notes{The upsurge of LLMs is creating opportunities and novel applications in different domains and data science is not the exception. In this section, we want you to explore how LLMs can be included in your data analytics pipelines. Through small examples, we expect to spark your interest in these tools.}

\notes{We will start by asking questions to an LLM about the nature of our data. We will try to reproduce a data exploration process similar to the one we implemented in the previous section (i.e., data description and visualisation). Before asking questions, we should install the libraries that enable the interaction with LLMs from Python code.}
