\notes{There is potential for both explicit and implicit discrimination on the basis of race, religion, sexuality or health status. All of these are prohibited under European law but can pass unawares or be implicit.}

\notes{The GDPR is the General Data Protection Regulation, but a better name for it would simply be Good Data Practice Rules. It covers how to deal with discrimination which has a consequential effect on the individual. For example, entrance to university, access to loans or insurance. But the new phenomenon is dealing with a series of inconsequential decisions that taken together have a consequential effect.}

\notes{Statistics as a community is also focused on the single consequential effect of an analysis (efficacy of drugs, or distribution of Mosquito nets). Associated with happenstance data is *happenstance decision making*.}

\notes{These algorithms behind these decisions are developed in a particular context. The so-called Silicon Valley bubble. But they are deployed across the world. To address this, a key challenge is capacity building in contexts which are remote from the Western norm.}
