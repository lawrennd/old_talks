\subsection{Information Dynamics}

\slides{* Potential for information feedback loops.
* Hypothetical streams are instantiated.
* Nature hypothesis (e.g. price prediction) can effect reality.
* Leads to information dynamics, similar to dynamics of governors.
* See e.g. [Closed Loop Data Science](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/) at Glasgow.

\notes{With all the second guessing within a complex automated decision-making system, there are potential problems with information dynamics, the 'closed loop' problem, where the sub-systems are being approximated (second guessing) and predictions downstream are being affected.

This leads to the need for a closed loop analysis, for example, see the ["Closed Loop Data Science"](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/computing/research/researchsections/ida-section/closedloop/) project led by Rod Murray-Smith at Glasgow.}
