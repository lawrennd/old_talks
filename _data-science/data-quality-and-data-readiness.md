\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Machine Learning}

$$\text{data} + \text{model} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$

\subsection{Code and Data Separation}

* Classical computer science separates code and data.
* Machine learning short-circuits this separation.

\subsection{Conclusions}

* Data is modern software
* We need to revisit software engineering and computer science in this context.
