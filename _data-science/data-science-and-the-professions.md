title: "Data Science and the Professions"
abstract: >
  Machine learning methods and software are becoming widely
  deployed. But as we deploy algorithms that operate on individual data, how do we account for their effect on society? In terms of the practice of data
  science, we seem to be at a similar point today as software
  engineering was in the early 1980s. Best practice is not widely
  understood or deployed. One aspect of professions is trust. How can we bring trust to the data-sphere?

* These are interpretable models: vital for disease etc.
* Modern machine learning methods are less interpretable
* Example: face recognition

\newslide{Conclusion}

* Artificial Intelligence and Data Science are fundamentally different.

* In one you are dealing with data collected by happenstance.

* In the other you are trying to build systems in the real world, often by actively collecting data.

* Our approaches to systems design are building powerful machines that
will be deployed in evolving environments.
