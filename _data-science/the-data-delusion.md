title: The Data Delusion
abstract: "The race on to develop the next generation of artificially intelligent
  algorithms, recent successes in hitherto unmanageable problems have somewhat blinded
  us to our own capabilities. Despite the commercial success of the current generation
  of learning algorithms, the time has come for the academic community to take stock.
  Have we really got the tools in place to solve the next generation of learning problems?
  Or is our current confidence in our toolsets misplaced? In this talk we\u2019ll
  develop at least one direction where our capabilities are lacking."
