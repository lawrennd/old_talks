  In this talk we will firstly set the landscape of machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science by describing what characteristics they share, and how they differ. We'll then shift focus to the promise and challenges associated with both Data Science and Artficial Intelligence, with particular attention paid to the potential for a "data crisis" and challenges in "machine learning systems design".

\subsection{Data Science}

* New technologies historically led to new professions:
    * Brunel (born 1806): Civil, mechanical, naval
    * Tesla (born 1856): Electrical and power
    * William Shockley (born 1910): Electronic 
    * Watts S. Humphrey (born 1927): Software


### The Software Crisis

>The major cause of the software crisis is that the machines have
>become several orders of magnitude more powerful! To put it quite
>bluntly: as long as there were no machines, programming was no problem
>at all; when we had a few weak computers, programming became a mild
>problem, and now we have gigantic computers, programming has become an
>equally gigantic problem.
>
> Edsger Dijkstra, The Humble Programmer

### The Data Crisis

>The major cause of the data crisis is that machines have become more
>interconnected than ever before. Data access is therefore cheap, but
>data quality is often poor or personally sensitive. We need cheap high quality
>data and systems which protect individual privacy.

\subsection{Deploying ML in Real World: Machine Learning Systems Design}

* Internet of Things
* Major new challenge for systems designers.
* AI systems are currently *fragile*
    * Example: Stuxnet
