\subsection{SciOps}

\notes{We're in the unusual position of managing "SciOps". That is scientific operations. The need for science on demand, science-as-a-service or as Neil sometimes called it at Amazon 0800-SCIENCE.}

\notes{The nature of the questions we are asked is that they will not necessarily sit within our domains of expertise, but they should be at least peripheral. Each of the members of the action team has been chosen to cover sections of the literature we believe will be important.}

\notes{This means that at times we will be operating outside our comfort zones, but as career scientists or domain experts, you will have the knowledge of the wider network of scientists and literature so that you know who to ask, where to look and what experiments to do. You also have access to members of the Steering Committee, the Working Group and the Advisory Group. Each of whom has shown themselves to be willing to respond rapidly to questions.}
