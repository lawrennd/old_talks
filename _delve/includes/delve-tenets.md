\subsection{Tenets}

\notes{I was fortunate to have had conversations about management of operational science with a lot of people, not just at Amazon. Fortunately, one of those people was [Niall Robinson](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/niall-robinson) from the Met Office Informatics Lab. Niall and I had talked extensively about ideas for managing operational science, mixing ideas from industry (in particular Amazon) with practices in an operational laboratory, such as the Met Office Informatics Lab. Fortunately, Niall had had some experience placing these ideas into practice and was able to emphasize which had really worked for him.}

\notes{One of those is *tenets*. Amazon uses tenets to understand characterize a team or projects way of operating. A good example is the tenets of the Principle Engieers' community, which are [made public here](https://www.amazon.jobs/en-gb/landing_pages/pe-community-tenets). Niall and I had both found tenets useful in driving operational science. We therefore created tenets for this group to set the tone in terms of ways of working.}

> A keystone of information coherence is our tenets for this project. The Tenets emphasise the prioritisation of our ways of working.
>
> This project has short deadlines, and quick turn around times. This can lead to stress. In moments of stress it can be difficult to decide how to prioritise. At these moments the Tenets can be particularly useful in reminding what the group priorities are. 
>
> The Tenets are core, but they are not set in stone. If you have better ideas or improvements, please suggest them!

> Tips for good tenets are: avoid platitudes, a good tenet is one that empowers individuals to make better decisions that align with the groups objectives (information coherence).

1.  We are steered by policy need.

2.  "It is amazing what you can accomplish if you do not care who gets
    the credit." We're here to be as useful as possible, as fast as
    possible, as a group.

3.  This work is multidisciplinary - everyone should ask questions, and
    expect to answer them to people from other disciplines in ways
    they can understand and scrutinise.

4.  We do not reinvent the wheel: we use existing analysis techniques
    and datasets wherever possible to answer questions.

5.  Being useful is more important than presentee-ism. We should be
    considerate of people who work different hours and have different
    commitments.

6.  We steer a path between the Hedgehog (too attached to a particular
    model) and the Fox (always considering worst case outcome).

\notes{We combined these tenets with other ideas that built on agile software engineering practice, but adapted for operational science. Including a Trello board, used kanban style, to track projects.}
