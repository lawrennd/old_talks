\section{Information Coherence}

\notes{Part of forming an efficient supply chain involves bottleneck analysis. In the supply chain of ideas, and across most organisations, a criticial bottleneck is our individual bandwidth.}

\notes{Humans have a information transmission rate (in spoken form) of around 100 bits per second. This is very low compared to e.g. our computers.}

\notes{Fortunately we are very intelligent, and investing time in thinking about the project, about those we're working with, what the challenges we're facing, allows us to account for one another in our decision making.}

\notes{Achieving information coherence is about ensuring that we're working together towards the same objectives. This reduces the need for detailed communication, because we have a better group-wide understanding of the common goals.}

\notes{That ensures that the supply chain of ideas runs smoothly.}
