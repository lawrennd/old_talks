* First meeting *7th April*
* First working group *16th April*

\notes{The Delve initiative is a group that was convened by the Royal Society to help provide data-driven insights about the pandemic, with an initial focus on exiting the first lockdown and particular interest in using the variation of strategies across different international governments to inform policy.}

\newslide{Data at the Heart}

\slides{* Use data to answer policy questions.
* Make international comparisons for input.
* Challenges: around getting data. Report out today!}

\notes{Right from the start the, data was at the heart of what DELVE does, but the reality is that little can be done without domain expertise and often the data we required wasn't available.}

\notes{However, even when it is not present, the notion of what data might be needed can also have a convening effect, bringing together multiple disciplines around the policy questons at hand. The Delve Data Readiness report [@Delve-data20]  makes recommendations for how we can improve our processes around data, but this talk also focuses on how data brings different disciplines together around data.}
