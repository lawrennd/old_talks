\subsection{The Avatar Model}

\slides{* Experts are bottlenecks.
* Action team built from *trusted collaborators* of experts.
* Thrice weekly meeting of Action Team.}

\notes{A common problem where advice is rapidly needed is that those who have most expertise are often under severe time pressure. Royal Society groups normally report over multiple years, and their structures are designed to assimilate evidence from the best experts over time. Our first report was produced for SAGE within two weeks of convening. In the supply chain of ideas this presents a key challenge in that the members of the steering committee and working group can act as a bottleneck. It was important for the project that we had a highly active team that could represent the thoughts of these experts and have rapid access to them. Each member of the steering committee and working group was asked to nominate an Avatar for this purpose. These Avatars brought domain expertise to the action team, as well as a deep understanding of the individual steering committee and working group members.}

\notes{As part of the communication bottlenecks, another challenge we face is how to bootstrap the knowledge of our Working Group and Steering Committee. The avatar model is such that each of those individuals should know, and have technical confidence in, at least one member of the Action Team. That member of the Action Team should have a good understanding of their corresponding Steering Group member, and should be able to represent their thought process in the rapid fire Action Team discussions that are resolving the multidisciplinary issues, where many of the tensions and opportunities will exist.}

\notes{Each member of the Action Team also knows well the mind of members of the Working Group and the Steering Committee. We will be using specific tools to facilitate the different rhythms of communication we require, ensuring we maintain information coherence both in the immediate time period, the short term weekly turn over of projects, and across the entire duration of the DELVE Initiative.}
