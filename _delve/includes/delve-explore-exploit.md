\section{Explore <-> Exploit}

\figure{\includediagram{\diagramsDir/delve/mccollum-plot}{85%}}{The McCollum Plot shows the manner in which work processes loosen as the Project develops. We use three phases to define our projects. Transition between explore and exploit is occuring at the interaction between Phase 1 and Phase 2.}{mccollum-plot}

\notes{A key mathematical concept we have from areas like *reinforcement learning* is the evolution of the nature of a project from conception to realisation. At the beginning of a project, there is a need to understand the question, to do research into the issues and develop the best strategy for resolving the question. As the deadline for an answer approaches, it becomes necessary to double down on, and refine, a particular strategy. This transition, from exploration to the refinement of a strategy is known in machine learning as the *explore*-*exploit* trade off. In management science, a similar process is known as *divergence*-*convergence*.}

\notes{In rapid management of science cycling through the explore/exploit phases is a critical aspect of a successful project.}

\notes{A critical challenge in the supply chain of ideas is ensuring we're getting input at the explore stage from all our channels. This type of input is particularly important at the start of the cycle, but new ideas being introduced during the convergence phase can be disruptive.}

\subsection{Three Phase Approach}

\slides{* Light touch approach to projects.
* Phase -1: Pre-conception
* Phase 0: Conception
* Phase 1: Scoping
* Phase 2: Proof of Concept}

\notes{To support the introduction of ideas and the transition between explore and exploit. We have a three phase approach to project management. The phases are within the control of the Action Team Members.}

\notes{The approach is best illustrated by touring our software tools where we have implemented our ideas.}

\notes{Each tool is associated with a particular rhythm of information transfer.}
