# First of all ...

**THANK YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS!**

# Retrospective

Around the group from last week.

* One positive.
* One challenge.

Use the chat window to add your thoughts and agree where appropriate.

# Mitigation

1. What actions should we take to improve processes?

# Horizon Scanning

* What are incoming priorities?
* From Venki:
1. Seasonal and temperature dependence (presumably worry about second wave in winter?)
2. effects of population density and urbanisation of spread (staged exits from lockdown? or use of various measures by context, including masks? )
3. Role of children in transmission (Obviously school problem)
4. Percentage asymptomatic (there is some in the mask study already).

# Anything else?
