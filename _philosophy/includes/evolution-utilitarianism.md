\subsection{Evolution and Utilitarianism}

* Bentham was not aware of Darwin's principle of natural selection
* Bentham believed that we should take an action if it maximised the happiness of the population (thereby minimising pain). 
* His utility function was the sum of the happiness of the population. 


\subsection{John Stuart Mill}

* Struggled with the idea that a night of debauchery was the same form of happiness.
* See also Epicurius


\subsection{Natural Selection}

* Species evolve through natural selection
* Bentham's idea was that we should maximize happiness. 
* In reality happiness is some form of *intermediate* reward.

\subsection{Mathematics of Change}

* Driven by Newton and [Leibniz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gottfried_Wilhelm_Leibniz)'s work differential calculus. 
* Actually happiness is some (monotonic) function of the gradient of whatever personal utility function we have. 
* John Stuart Mill's variation on utilitarianism considered 'higher pleasures', such as the pleasure gained from literature and learning. (See also Eleni Vasilaki on Epicurus @Vasilaki:epicurius17)
* our happiness must be integrated to form our utility.
