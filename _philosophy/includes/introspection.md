\subsection{Artificial Intelligence and Introspection}

\slides{
* Religion at its most powerful contextualizes us
* Creating artificial systems described as intelligence also contextualises us
}
\notes{Ignoring the cartoon view of religion we've outlined above and focussing more on how religion can bring strength to people in their day-to-day living, religious environments bring a place to self reflect and meditate on our existence, and the wider cosmos. How are we here? What is our role? What makes us different?}

\notes{Creating machine intelligences characterizes the manner in which we are different, helps us understand what is special about us rather than the machine.}

\notes{I have in the past argued strongly against the term artificial intelligence but there is a sense in which it is a good term. If we think of artificial plants, then we have the right sense in which we are creating an artificial intelligence. An artificial plant is fundamentally different from a real plant, but can appear similar, or from a distance identical. However, a creator of an artificial plant gains a greater appreciation for the complexity of a natural plant.}

\notes{In a similar way, we might expect that attempts to emulate human intelligence would lead to a deeper appreciation of that intelligence. This type of reflection on who we are has a lot in common with many of the (to me) most endearing characteristics of religion.}

\notes{A final parallel between the world of AI and that of religion is the conundrums they raise for us. In particular the tradeoffs between a paternalistic society and individual freedoms.}
