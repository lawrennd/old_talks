\subsection{Singularians}

\notes{The notion of Superintelligence in, e.g. Nick Bostrom's book [@Bostrom-superintelligence14], is that of an infallible omniscience. A major narrative of the book is that the challenge of Superintelligence according is to constrain the power of such an entity. In practice, this narrative is strongly related to Laplace's "straw superman". No such intelligence could exist due to our ignorance, in practice any real intelligence must express *doubt*.}

\notes{Elon Musk has proposed that the only way to defeat the inevitable omniscience would be to augment ourselves with machine like capabilities. Ray Kurzweil has pushed the notion of developing ourselves by augmenting our existing cortex with direct connection to the internet.}

\notes{Within Silicon Valley there seems to be a particular obsession with 'uploading'. The idea is that once the brain is connected, we can achieve immortality by continuing to exist digitally in an artificial environment of our own creation while our physical body is left behind us. They want to remove the individual bandwidth limitation we place on ourselves.}

\slides{* Removing the bandwidth limitation: removing our humanity?}

\notes{But embodiment factors [@Lawrence:embodiment17] imply that we are defined by our limitations. Removing the bandwidth limitation removes what it means to be human.}

\notes{In Singularianism doomsday is the 'technological singularity', the moment at which computers rapidly outstrip our capabilities and take over our world. The high priests are the scientists, and the aim is to bring about the latter while restraining the former.

\notes{*Singularianism* is to religion what *scientology* is to science. Scientology is religion expressing itself as science and Singularism is science expressing itself as religion.}

\slides{* *Singularianism* and religion equivalent to *scientology* and science?}
