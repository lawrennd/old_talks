\subsection{Uncertainty and Absolutism}

\notes{One of the most understood aspects of evolution is the idea that evolution is survival of the fittest. It's better described of non-survival of the non-fit, and what fit even means is highly subjective. Any utility function evolves socially andwith our environment.  ["Survival of the fittest"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_of_the_fittest) is not due to Darwin it's associated with [Herbert Spencer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_Spencer) and closely associated with social Darwinism which has little to do with the way that evolution operates in practice.}

\subsection{Absolute Policies}

\notes{Because of these uncertainties there's an emergent rule:}
\slides{* There is only one absolute policy we should follow. }

> There will be no single absolute policy that should be followed slavishly in all circumstances

\notes{In the world of trolley problems this perhaps maps best to the version of the problem where to save the lives of five people you have to push a large gentleman off a bridge.}

\slides{* The second example is largely contrived, and riddled with uncertainty.}

\subsection{Uncertainty: The Tyger that Burns Bright}

> Tyter Tyger, burning bright,
> In the forests of the night;
> What immortal hand or eye,
> Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
>
> First verse of The Tyger by William Blake, 1794

\notes{A major challenge with this notion of utility is the assumption that we can describe our objectives mathematically. Once this notion is challenged some severe weaknesses in the way we do machine learning can be seen to emerge.}
