\subsection{Rational Behaviour}

\notes{My argument is that rational behviour requires variation. That it allows us to sustain a variety of approaches to life. That there is no single utility that we should all be optimising.}

\slides{* Sustain a variety of approaches to life.
* Complex explanations such as half-time football punditry.
* Also clinical experts [@Meehl-clinicalstatistical54]. Meehl suggested they 'try to be clever and think outside the box'.}

\notes{So the observations that humans "over complicate" whether it's in football punditry or as @Meehl-clinicalstatistical54 observes in clinical prediction, is associated with 


\subsection{One Correct Solution}

\notes{The idea that there is one solution and that we can somehow have access to it has led to some of the horrors of science. For example, in eugenics, the notion of artificial selection (where some aspect(s) of a species is/are selected and accentuated through artifical breeding) is applied to humans. Disregarding the natural moral repulsion this engenders, it also betrays some simplistic misunderstandings of the process of evolution. What is OK for greyhounds, wheat breeds, race horses, sheep and cows is not OK for humans.}

\slides{* Artificial Selection and Eugenics.
* OK for race horses, greyhounds, crops, sheep and cows 
* Not OK for the humans.}


\newslide{One Correct Solution}

\slides{* Flawed understanding of science
* Animals in a species become too specialised then they may not be able to respond to changing circumstances. 
    * Think of cheetahs and eagles vs rats and pigeons.}


\newslide{Similar Ideas Socially}

> I may not agree with many people's subjective approach to life, I may even believe it to be severely sub-optimal. But I should not presume to know better, even if prior experience shows that my own 'way of being' is effective. 
>
> Variation is vitally important for robustness. There may be future circumstances where my approaches fail utterly, and other ways of being are better.


\newslide{A Universal Utility}

\slides{* Quality of our individual subjective utilities measured by effectiveness.
* But it is survival of entire species that dominates long term.
* A universal utility by which we are judged is difficult to define.}

\notes{If we do all have different approaches to life, then in the long run the quality of these approaches is measured by a effectiveness (which will also owe a lot to luck). From a species persistence perspective, each of these approaches is one component in our make up. The notion of a universl utility by which we are all judged is difficult (or impossible) to define.}

\subsection{The Real Ethical Dilemma}

\slides{* Trolley Problem is an oversimplification.
* Driverless cars: 
    * introduce driverless cars and bring about a 90% reduction in deaths 
	* What if remaining deaths are all cyclists?}
	
\notes{For driverless cars, the trolley problem is an oversimplificiation, because when people are killed it will not be through "reflective decisions" that those deaths occur, but through a consipiracy of happenstance events.}

\notes{That does not mean there are no ethical dilemmas, any automation technology will have uneven effects across society. So, for example, it may be that introducing driverless cars we achieve a 90% reduction in deaths. But what if all those that now die are cyclists?}
