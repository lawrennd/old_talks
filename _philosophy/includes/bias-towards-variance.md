\subsection{Prospect Theory}

\slides{* Daniel Kahneman's Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics was awarded for the idea of *prospect theory*. 
* Kahneman describes the theory and its background in his book, "Thinking Fast and Slow" [@Kahneman-fastslow11]. 
* Empirical theory about how people are responsive to change in circumstance, not absolute circumstance.}

\notes{Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Memorial Prize for work on the idea of prospect theory. The theory is based on empirical studies around how humans make decisions, and suggests that not only are they sensitive to change of circumstance, rather than absolute circumstance, there is an asymmetry to the sensitivity associated with negative and positive changes.}

\notes{@Kahneman-fastslow11 was a book that presented this idea but also popularised the notion of dual process cognition: where thoughts are separated into fast thinking and slow thinking. In the history of the philosophy of ethics, an ethical decision has always been associated with intentional or *reflective* actions. Sylvie Delacroix's book *Habitual Ethics* [@Delacroix-habitual22] establishes the case for a theory of ethics arising from habitual (presumably fast-thinking) decisions.}

\subsection{Subjective Utility}

\slides{* Bentham's ideas focussed around the idea of a global utility.
* Natural selection insists there must be *variation* in the population
* Without variation, there is no separation between effective and ineffective strategies.}

\notes{Jeremy Bentham's ideas around maximising happiness are focussed on the ide of a global utility, but natural selection suggests that there should be variation in the population, otherwise there will be no separation between effective and ineffective strategies. So in practice utilities (if they exist) must be subjective, they would vary from individual to individual.}

\subsection{A Cognitive Bias towards Variance}

\slides{* Kahneman explores our tendency to produce overcomplicated explanations
* Prediction is
    $$ \text{model} + \text{data} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$
* Models fail as overly simple or overly complex}

\notes{Kahneman's book explores various ways in which humans might be considered "irrational", for example our tendency to produce overcomplicated explanations. If prediction is of the form
$$ \text{model} + \text{data} \rightarrow \text{prediction}$$
then Kahneman explores the seemingly reasonable proposal that predictions from different experts should be consistent. After all, how could the predictions be correct if they are inconsistent. From a statistical perspective, simpler models tend to be more consistent. So this suggests to Kahneman that humans overcomplicate. However, once we accept that errors will be made (e.g. due to uncertainty) then we can notice that a push for consistency is a push for consistency of error.}
