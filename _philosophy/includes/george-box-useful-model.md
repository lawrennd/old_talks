\subsection{Some Models are Useful}

\notes{So, when do we fall outside this important domain where we have the correct model? According to @Box-science76, all the time.}

> All models are wrong, but some are useful

\notes{Box's important quote has become worn by overuse (like a favorite
sweater). Indeed, I most often see it quoted at the beginning of a talk in a way that confuses correlation with causality. Presentations proceed in the following way. (1) Here is my model. (2) It is wrong. (3) Here is George Box's quote. (4) My model is wrong, but it might be useful. Sometimes I feel at stage (4) a confusion about the arrow of causality occurs, it feels to me that people are almost saying "*Because* my model is wrong it *might* be useful."}

\notes{Perhaps we should be more focusing on the quote from the same paper[^rich]

[^rich]: This quote was first highlighted to me by Richard D. Wilkinson.}

> Since all models are wrong the scientist must be alert to what is importantly wrong. It is inappropriate to be concerned about mice when there are tigers abroad.
