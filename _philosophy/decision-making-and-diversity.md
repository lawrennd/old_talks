\newslide{Conclusion}
\slides{
* Uncertainty of the correct utility implies  'correct' decision is difficult produce or verify. 
* Tendency to seek proxies such as *consistency* in decision making. 
* Consistent algorithms oversimplifies.
* Society would be more robust if diversity of solutions and opinions are sustained and respected.
