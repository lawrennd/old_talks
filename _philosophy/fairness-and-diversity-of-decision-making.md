title: "Fairness and Diversity of Decision Making"
abstract: >
  Mathematical definitions of fairness insist on clearly categorized groups and clear mathematical interpretations of fairness. In law this arises through the concept of *unlawful* descrimination. 
  
  There is no such thing as a correct model. We must accept that our predictions will sometimes be wrong. In the face of this certainty we have a choice: how we should be wrong.
  
  We can choose to be wrong by over-simplifying or we can choose to be wrong by over-complicating (given the available data).
  
  In machine learning this is known as the bias-variance dilemma. In this talk we consider the implications of the bias-variance dilemma for fairness of decision making.
