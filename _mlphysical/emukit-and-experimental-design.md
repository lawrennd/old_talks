abstract: >
  We have introduced you to the sequential process by which we decide to evaluation points in a simulation through Bayesian optimization. In this lecture we introduce Emukit. Emukit is a software framework for decision programming via surrogate modelling and emulation. It formalizes the process of selecting a point via an acquisition function and provides a general framework for incorporating surrogate models and the acquisition function of your choice. We'll then show how Emukit can be used for *active* experimental design.

\subsection{Conclusions}

\notes{We've introduced the Emukit software and outlined its design philosophy. We've then performed some simple examples using Emukit to perform *experimental design* as a task. In particular we saw how we could define the task as an acquisition funciton, a loop, an emulator model and a target function.

You can compare the design of this software with its predecessor, `GPyOpt`, which is less modular in its design, and more focussed on Bayesian optimization.}
